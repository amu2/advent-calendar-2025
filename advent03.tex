  {G\textsubscript{2} is the smallest exceptional Lie group and the full
   automorphism group of the octonions. Every map in G\textsubscript{2}
   preserves octonionic multiplication and the norm. In the model, this
   makes G\textsubscript{2} the \emph{gatekeeper} of the internal
   structure: any internal operator, symmetry or interaction must respect
   G\textsubscript{2} invariance. Today we meet G\textsubscript{2} as the
   minimal exceptional symmetry from which the larger exceptional group
   F\textsubscript{4} will later emerge.} % #5 Key Insight

\section*{What is G\texorpdfstring{$_2$}{G2}?}

\AdventInitial{T}{he} group $G_2$ can be defined in many equivalent ways.
For the octonionic story, the most natural is:

\[
  G_2 = \mathrm{Aut}(\mathbb{O}),
\]

the group of all linear transformations of $\mathbb{O}$ that preserve the
octonionic product and the norm. It is a 14-dimensional, compact,
connected, simply-connected Lie group and the smallest of the five
exceptional Lie groups.

Concretely:

\begin{itemize}
  \item $G_2$ preserves the multiplication table of the seven imaginary
        units $e_1,\dots,e_7$.
  \item It preserves the standard norm $|x|^2 = x\bar{x}$.
  \item It acts transitively on the unit sphere of imaginary octonions,
        with stabiliser isomorphic to $SU(3)$.
\end{itemize}

In other words, $G_2$ is the full continuous symmetry group of the
octonionic number system itself.

\section*{Why ``minimal exceptional'' matters}

As a Lie group, $G_2$ is:

\begin{itemize}
  \item too small to host all Standard Model symmetries directly,
  \item but large enough to control the essential nonassociative structure
        of $\mathbb{O}$,
  \item and exceptional—meaning it does not fit into the infinite $A_n$,
        $B_n$, $C_n$, $D_n$ series.
\end{itemize}

This makes $G_2$ an ideal starting point:

\begin{itemize}
  \item It is restrictive enough to strongly constrain internal operators.
  \item It is flexible enough to embed subgroups that resemble
        $SU(3)_C\times SU(2)_L\times U(1)_Y$ in appropriate ways.
  \item It naturally sits inside the larger exceptional group
        $F_4$, the automorphism group of the Albert algebra
        $H_3(\mathbb{O})$.
\end{itemize}

\section*{G\texorpdfstring{$_2$}{G2} as a gatekeeper of allowed operators}

In the model, internal operators (heptagon operator, radius operator,
rotors, compressors) are not arbitrary matrices; they must be compatible
with the $G_2$-structure. Informally:

\begin{quote}
  If an operator would break $G_2$ in an uncontrolled way, it is not part
  of the fundamental toolbox.
\end{quote}

This has two important consequences:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Restricted parameter space:}
    many couplings and mass terms that are allowed in a generic
    field-theory Lagrangian are simply forbidden by $G_2$.
  \item \textbf{Natural subgroups:}
    gauge groups that actually appear (or approximate) in low-energy
    physics are precisely those that can be embedded in $G_2$ (and later
    in $F_4$) in a structurally compatible way.
\end{enumerate}

G\textsubscript{2} thus serves as a first filter between ``any algebraic
construction on $\mathbb{R}^8$'' and ``constructions that respect the
octonionic number system''.

\section*{From G\texorpdfstring{$_2$}{G2} to F\texorpdfstring{$_4$}{F4}}

Later in the calendar, the Albert algebra $H_3(\mathbb{O})$ will appear,
and with it the larger exceptional group $F_4$:

\[
  F_4 = \mathrm{Aut}\big(H_3(\mathbb{O})\big).
\]

The relationship is hierarchical:

\begin{itemize}
  \item $G_2$ controls the algebra of $\mathbb{O}$ itself.
  \item $H_3(\mathbb{O})$ builds $3\times3$ Hermitian matrices over
        $\mathbb{O}$.
  \item $F_4$ controls the automorphisms of this larger Jordan algebra.
\end{itemize}

From the perspective of the calendar:

\begin{itemize}
  \item early days: $G_2$ and triality structure the octonionic stage,
  \item middle days: $F_4$ organises the symmetry atlas on the Albert
        algebra,
  \item later days: potentials and equilibria on this atlas fix physical
        scales and constants.
\end{itemize}

G\textsubscript{2} is the first rung on this exceptional ladder.

\section*{Conceptual gain from G\texorpdfstring{$_2$}{G2}}

Putting $G_2$ at the base of the internal symmetry story has clear
advantages:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Uniqueness:} There is only one real division algebra with
    7 imaginary units, and only one connected Lie group that preserves it:
    $G_2$. This is about as far from ``model building by choice'' as one
    can get.
  \item \textbf{Rigidity:} Once octonions are chosen, $G_2$ is fixed.
    Internal symmetries are no longer free groups to be dialled but are
    inherited from this starting point.
  \item \textbf{Roadmap:} The inclusion $G_2\subset F_4$ provides a clear
    path from basic number system to full symmetry atlas.
\end{enumerate}

In this sense, $G_2$ is not just an exotic group in a classification
table; it is the minimal exceptional guardian of the octonionic world.
