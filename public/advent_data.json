      "content": "<h3>A gentle introduction: Why quaternions matter</h3>\n<p>magine you want to describe the internal structure of\nelementary particles—not where they are in space, but the hidden\nproperties that make a left-handed electron different from a\nright-handed one, or a neutrino different from a quark. One natural\nquestion is: what kind of ``number system'' could serve as the stage for\nthese internal degrees of freedom?</p>\n<p>The usual real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$ give us one dimension: a single\nline. Complex numbers $\\mathbb{C}$ give us two dimensions and have\nproven essential in quantum mechanics. But what if we need more\ndimensions, and what if we want something that behaves like\nmultiplication—where combining two elements gives another element of the\nsame type?</p>\n<p>This is where <em>quaternions</em> enter the story. Discovered in 1843 by\nWilliam Rowan Hamilton, quaternions extend complex numbers to four\ndimensions. You can think of them as having one ``real'' part and three\n``imaginary'' parts, usually called $\\mathbf{i},\\mathbf{j},\\mathbf{k}$.\nThese three imaginary units look like coordinates in 3D space, but with\na special multiplication rule that makes them <em>noncommutative</em>:\nin general, $\\mathbf{i}\\mathbf{j}\\neq\\mathbf{j}\\mathbf{i}$.</p>\n<p>Formally,\n\\[\n \\mathbb{H} = \\{\\, a + b\\,\\mathbf{i} + c\\,\\mathbf{j} + d\\,\\mathbf{k}\n \\mid a,b,c,d\\in\\mathbb{R} \\,\\},\n\\]\nwith\n\\[\n \\mathbf{i}^2=\\mathbf{j}^2=\\mathbf{k}^2 = \\mathbf{ijk} = -1.\n\\]\nThe key structural feature is the rigid split\n\\[\n \\mathbb{H} \\;\\cong\\; \\mathbb{R} \\oplus \\mathbb{R}^3,\n\\]\none scalar component and a three-dimensional imaginary part: a\n$1\\oplus3$ pattern.</p>\n<h3>De Casteljau's matrix view: quaternions as birotations</h3>\n<p>A particularly clear picture, developed in detail by de Casteljau\n\\cite{deCasteljau1987}, is to represent quaternions as $4\\times4$ real\nmatrices acting on a four-dimensional Euclidean space $E_4$. In this\nlanguage, a unit quaternion becomes a <em>birotation</em>: a simultaneous\nrotation in two orthogonal 2-planes of $E_4$.</p>\n<p>Schematically, one can write a unit quaternion in a normal form where\nits matrix representation looks like\n\\[\nQ_N(\\varphi) \\;=\\;\n\\rho\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\cos\\varphi & -\\sin\\varphi & 0 & 0 \\\\\n\\sin\\varphi & \\cos\\varphi & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & \\cos\\varphi & -\\sin\\varphi \\\\\n0 & 0 & \\sin\\varphi & \\cos\\varphi\n\\end{pmatrix},\n\\]\nup to a suitable choice of orthonormal basis. Geometrically:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>The first $2\\times2$ block rotates one plane in $E_4$ by angle\n $\\varphi$.\n <li>The second $2\\times2$ block rotates an orthogonal plane by the\n <em>same</em> angle.\n</ul>\n<p>The associated ``antiquaternion'' corresponds to a contra-rotation\nwhere one of the planes is rotated in the opposite sense. De Casteljau\nuses this birotation picture to make explicit the eigenvalues, the\ndeterminant structure and the rare circumstances under which such\n$4\\times4$ unitary matrices commute.</p>\n<p>For us, the important message is: quaternions are not just formal\nsymbols; they encode very concrete four-dimensional rotations with a\nrigid internal structure.</p>\n<h3>$SU(2)$ and the $1\\oplus3$ pattern</h3>\n<p>From the quaternion point of view, the group $SU(2)$ of weak isospin is\nnothing but the group of unit quaternions:\n\\[\n \\{q\\in\\mathbb{H}\\mid |q|=1\\} \\;\\simeq\\; SU(2).\n\\]\nLeft multiplication by a unit quaternion acts as an $SU(2)$ transformation\non the imaginary part $\\mathbb{R}^3$, while the scalar part is left\ninvariant.</p>\n<p>Physically, this means:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>The scalar direction (the ``$1$'' in $1\\oplus3$) behaves like an\n isospin singlet.\n <li>The three imaginary directions (the ``$3$'') form a triplet under\n $SU(2)$, in perfect analogy with weak isospin triplets.\n</ul>\n<p>In other words, weak isospin is not an arbitrary label group we bolt\nonto particles. It is built into the structure of a specific\nfour-dimensional number system and its matrix representation as\nbirotations.</p>\n<h3>From $\\mathbb{H</h3>$ to $\\mathbb{O}$: doubling the rehearsal}\n<p>Why spend an entire Advent day on this four-dimensional rehearsal if our\nmain stage is the eight-dimensional octonionic world?</p>\n<p>Because several patterns scale up almost literally:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>The split $\\mathbb{H} \\cong 1\\oplus3$ becomes, in the octonionic\n setting, a richer decomposition of $\\mathbb{R}^8$ into blocks that\n can host one full generation of internal quantum numbers.\n <li>The role of unit quaternions as birotations in $E_4$ is taken\n over by suitable $8\\times8$ action matrices built from octonionic\n left/right multiplication on $\\mathbb{R}^8$.\n <li>The place of $SU(2)\\subset\\mathrm{Aut}(\\mathbb{H})$ is taken\n over by the exceptional group $G_2\\subset\\mathrm{Aut}(\\mathbb{O})$,\n and the Spin(8) triality structure introduced on First Advent\n Sunday.\n</ul>\n<p>Seen from this angle, moving from quaternions to octonions is not a\nwild leap into a bizarre algebra. It is the next and final step in a\nsequence of division algebras: $\\mathbb{R}$, $\\mathbb{C}$,\n$\\mathbb{H}$, $\\mathbb{O}$—each adding just enough structure to host a\nricher symmetry.</p>\n<h3>Why this day matters in the Advent story</h3>\n<p>The quaternion day serves as a conceptual bridge between two worlds:</p>\n<ol>\n <li>It anchors the exotic ideas of octonions, $G_2$ and triality in\n a familiar setting: $SU(2)$, spin, weak isospin and four-dimensional\n rotations.\n <li>It shows that the algebraic backbone we propose for one\n generation (octonions and Albert algebra) is a natural extension of\n the quaternionic picture, not an unrelated construction.\n <li>It prepares us to read later operator identities and action\n matrices as geometric statements about rotations, not as ad hoc\n matrix tricks.\n</ol>\n<p>After this gentle quaternion warm-up, the following sheets return to the\nfull octonionic stage, now with a clearer intuition of where $SU(2)$ and\nits $1\\oplus3$ pattern are coming from in the algebraic background.</p>\n<p>\\small\n\\begin{thebibliography}{9}</p>\n<p>\\bibitem{deCasteljau1987}\nP.~de Casteljau,\n\\newblock {\\em Les Quaternions},\n\\newblock Paris: Hermès, 1987.</p>\n<p>\\bibitem{Hamilton1844}\nW.~R.~Hamilton,\n\\newblock ``On quaternions; or on a new system of imaginaries in algebra,''\n\\newblock {\\em Philos.\\ Mag.} <strong>25</strong>, 489--495 (1844).</p>\n<p>\\end{thebibliography}\n\\normalsize</p>",

      "subtitle": "<p>When space, matter and antimatter share the same dimension</p>",
      "keyInsight": "<p>Spin(8) has a unique feature: <em>triality</em>. It admits three\n equivalent 8-dimensional representations—one vector representation\n $V_8$ and two chiral spinor representations $S_8^+$ and $S_8^-$. This\n is not a decorative curiosity: it provides a geometric template for\n three kinds of ``8-dimensional stuff'' that can later be read as\n space, matter and antimatter. Today we meet triality as a symmetry\n between representations; later days will turn it into the organising\n principle behind three fermion generations.</p>",
      "content": "<p>n \nmost areas of physics, vectors and spinors are fundamentally different creatures. \nVectors describe things like position, momentum, or electric fields—they transform in a straightforward way under rotations. Spinors describe fermions like electrons and quarks—they transform in a more subtle, \"square-root\" way that captures the essence of quantum spin.</p>\n<p>But there's one special case where this distinction blurs: the group $\\mathrm{Spin}(8)$, which governs rotations in eight dimensions. This group has a unique property called triality, discovered by Élie Cartan in 1925. It says that $\\mathrm{Spin}(8)$ has three eight-dimensional representations—one vector representation $V_8$ and two chiral spinor representations $S_8^+$ and $S_8^-$—and these three are related by a symmetry that permutes them.</p>\n<p>Think about what this means: in eight dimensions, \"space-like\" and \"matter-like\" degrees of freedom can be put on equal footing. There's an automorphism of $\\mathrm{Spin}(8)$ that literally rotates the vector representation into a spinor representation and vice versa. This is not true in four dimensions, or six dimensions, or any other dimension—only in eight.</p>\n<p>Why does this matter for particle physics? Because the octonionic model we're building naturally lives in eight dimensions, and triality provides a geometric template for organizing internal degrees of freedom. If we have three equivalent eight-dimensional \"slots,\" it's natural to ask: could these three slots correspond to the three generations of quarks and leptons?</p>\n<p>This is not just numerology. The Standard Model has exactly three generations—three copies of the same pattern of quarks and leptons, with identical gauge quantum numbers but different masses. No one knows why. Conventional field theory offers no explanation; it simply accepts \"three\" as an input parameter.</p>\n<p>But in an octonionic model with triality, the number three is not arbitrary. It's built into the symmetry structure of $\\mathrm{Spin}(8)$. The three representations $(V_8, S_8^+, S_8^-)$ provide three natural \"homes\" for three copies of the internal structure. Triality doesn't just allow three generations—it suggests them.</p>\n<p>Today's sheet introduces triality as a symmetry between representations. Later in the calendar, we'll see how this abstract symmetry unfolds into the concrete pattern of three fermion families. For now, the key takeaway is simple: the number three in \"three generations\" might not be an accident. It might be the echo of an exceptional symmetry in eight dimensions.</p>\n<p>Let us see how triality organizes the octonionic stage.</p>\n<h3>Three eights instead of one</h3>\n<p>In most Lie groups, vector and spinor representations\nlook different and behave differently. Spin(8) is special: it has</p>\n<p>\\[\n V_8,\\qquad S_8^+,\\qquad S_8^-,\n\\]</p>\n<p>three irreducible 8-dimensional representations that are related by a\nnontrivial outer automorphism group of order 6. This automorphism group\nacts by permuting $(V_8, S_8^+, S_8^-)$; its $\\mathbb{Z}_3$-part is called\n<em>triality</em>:</p>\n<p>\\[\n S:\\quad V_8 \\;\\longrightarrow\\; S_8^+ \n \\;\\longrightarrow\\; S_8^- \n \\;\\longrightarrow\\; V_8.\n\\]</p>\n<p>Geometrically, the three representations are on equal footing: no one is\nmore fundamental than the others.\n<h3>Why triality matters for an octonionic model</h3></p>\n<p>Octonions $\\mathbb{O}$ naturally support an 8-dimensional real\nrepresentation. In the model described by this calendar, one uses:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>an 8D ``vector-like'' role associated with internal space\n directions,\n <li>two 8D ``spinor-like'' roles associated with chiral matter and\n antimatter sectors.\n</ul>\n<p>Triality then becomes the statement that there is an underlying symmetry\nrelating these three roles. It is the reason why it is natural to package\ninternal degrees of freedom in blocks of size 8 and why it is not absurd\nto think of space-like and matter-like sectors as different faces of the\nsame algebraic coin.</p>\n<h3>From three 8D reps to three generations</h3>\n<p>The plan for the calendar reserves a later day (12 December) for the\nstatement:</p>\n<blockquote>\n ``Three fermion generations mirror the three triality\n representations.''\n</blockquote>\n<p>Today we prepare that statement conceptually:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>If there is a symmetry that permutes $(V_8, S_8^+, S_8^-)$,\n it is natural to try to attach one 8D ``copy'' of the internal\n structure to each of them.\n <li>In particle language, this suggests three families of fermions\n with identical gauge quantum numbers but different ``triality\n label''.\n <li>The existence of <em>exactly</em> three such representations\n motivates the existence of <em>exactly</em> three generations, not\n one or four.\n</ul>\n<p>The details (how charges and masses are assigned in each block) are left\nto the later flavor and generation days.</p>\n<h3>Link to octonions and G$_2$</h3>\n<p>Spin(8) and octonions are tightly linked:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>The group $G_2$ is the automorphism group of the octonions\n $\\mathbb{O}$.\n <li>Spin(8) acts on $\\mathbb{O}$ in ways compatible with this\n $G_2$-structure.\n <li>Triality is a statement about how vector and spinor actions can be\n interchanged without breaking the internal octonionic structure.\n</ul>\n<p>In the broader project, this becomes one ingredient in the\n<em>symmetry atlas</em>:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>$G_2$ as the minimal exceptional symmetry (tomorrow),\n <li>$F_4$ as the automorphism group of the Albert algebra $H_3(\\mathbb{O})$,\n <li>triality as the bridge between space-like and spinor-like sectors.\n</ul>\n<h3>Conceptual gain from triality</h3>\n<p>What is gained by taking triality seriously?</p>\n<ol>\n <li><strong>Symmetry-based multiplicity:</strong>\n the multiplicity ``three'' is not an afterthought but a symmetry\n consequence.\n <li><strong>Unified treatment of sectors:</strong>\n space-like, matter-like and antimatter-like sectors share the same\n dimension and are related by an actual group action.\n <li><strong>Constraints for model building:</strong>\n any attempt to modify the number of generations must explain how\n triality is broken or extended.\n</ol>\n<p>Instead of asking ``Why three generations?'' as a bare phenomenological\nquestion, the model asks a more geometric one:</p>\n<blockquote>\n ``How does Spin(8) triality appear inside the octonionic/Albert\n structure, and how does it force a threefold replication of internal\n degrees of freedom?''\n</blockquote>\n<p>\\small\n\\begin{thebibliography}{9}</p>\n<p>\\bibitem{Cartan1925}\nE.~Cartan, ``Le principe de dualit\\'e et la th\\'eorie des groupes simples et semi-simples,'' Bull.\\ Sci.\\ Math. 49, 361--374 (1925).</p>\n<p>\\bibitem{Baez2002}\nJ.~C.~Baez, ``The octonions,'' Bull.\\ Amer.\\ Math.\\ Soc. 39, 145--205 (2002).</p>\n<p>\\end{thebibliography}\n\\normalsize</p>",

      "content": "<p>very number system has a symmetry group—the set of transformations that preserve its essential structure. For the real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$, the symmetry is almost trivial: only multiplication by $\\pm1$. For the complex numbers $\\mathbb{C}$, it is the unit circle $U(1)$ of complex numbers of modulus one, isomorphic to rotations in the plane and representable by real $2 \\times 2$ rotation matrices.\nFor the quaternions $\\mathbb{H}$, it's the 3-sphere of unit quaternions, which is isomorphic to the special unitary group $SU(2)$ of complex $2 \\times 2$ matrices, as we saw on Dec 1.</p>\n<p>What about the octonions? The symmetry group of the octonions—the transformations that preserve both the multiplication table and the norm—is called $G_2$. It's a 14-dimensional Lie group, and it's the smallest of the five exceptional Lie groups $G_2, F_4, E_6, E_7, E_8$. ``Exceptional'' means it doesn't fit into the infinite families of classical groups like $SU(n+1)=A_{n}$, $SO(2n+1)=B_n$, $SO(2n)=D_n$, or $Sp(n)=C_n$ (special unitary, special orthogonal or symplectic groups). It's a one-of-a-kind structure.</p>\n<p>Why does this matter for physics? Because $G_2$ acts as a gatekeeper. If we're building a model where internal degrees of freedom live in an octonionic space, then any operator, any symmetry, any interaction must respect the $G_2$ structure. You can't just write down arbitrary matrices and hope they make sense — they have to be compatible with the rigid multiplication rules of the octonions.</p>\n<p>This is a feature, not a bug. In conventional field theory, we have enormous freedom to choose gauge groups, representations, and couplings. This freedom is both a blessing and a curse: it allows us to fit data, but it doesn't explain why nature chose one particular set of parameters over another. With $G_2$ as the starting point, much of that freedom disappears. The structure is forced on us by the choice of octonions.</p>\n<p>Here's a concrete example: $G_2$ contains $SU(3)$ as a subgroup. In fact, if you pick any imaginary octonion and ask which transformations leave it fixed, you get a copy of $SU(3)$. This is not a coincidence — it's a hint that the color symmetry of the strong force might be a natural subgroup of the octonionic automorphism group.</p>\n<p>But $G_2$ is not large enough to contain the full Standard Model gauge group $SU(3) \\times SU(2) \\times U(1)$ directly. For that, we'll need to move to a larger structure: the Albert algebra $H_3(\\mathbb{O})$ and its automorphism group $F_4$, which we'll meet in the coming days. $G_2$ is the first rung on the exceptional ladder — the minimal exceptional symmetry that controls the octonionic stage itself.</p>\n<p>Think of today's sheet as introducing the guardian of the internal space. $G_2$ is not just an exotic group in a classification table. It's the symmetry that makes the octonions work as a number system, and in the model we're building, it's the symmetry that constrains which internal structures are allowed and which are forbidden.</p>\n<p>Let us see how $G_2$ guards the octonionic multiplication table.</p>\n<h3>What is $G_2$?</h3>\n<p>The group $G_2$ can be defined in many equivalent ways.\nFor the octonionic story, the most natural is:</p>\n<p>\\[\n G_2 = \\mathrm{Aut}(\\mathbb{O}),\n\\]\nthe group of all real-linear transformations of $\\mathbb{O}$ that preserve\nthe octonionic product (and hence the standard norm). It is a 14-dimensional,\ncompact, connected, simply connected simple Lie group and the smallest of the\nfive exceptional Lie groups.</p>\n<p>Concretely:\n<ul>\n <li>$G_2$ preserves the multiplication rules among the seven imaginary units $e_1,\\dots,e_7$.\n <li>It preserves the standard norm $|x|^2 = x\\bar{x}$.\n <li>It acts transitively on the unit sphere of imaginary octonions,\n with stabiliser isomorphic to $SU(3)$.\n</ul></p>\n<p>Equivalently, one can view $G_2$ as the subgroup of $SO(7)$ that preserves\nboth the Euclidean inner product and a distinguished $3$-form (or,\nequivalently, a cross product) on the $7$-dimensional space $\\mathbb{R}^7$ of imaginary\noctonions (those with vanishing real coordinates).</p>\n<p>In representation-theoretic terms, $G_2$ has rank~$2$, with two smallest\nnon-trivial representations:\n<ul>\n <li>the $7$-dimensional fundamental representation on the imaginary\n octonions, and\n <li>the $14$-dimensional adjoint representation on its Lie algebra\n $\\mathfrak{g}_2$.\n</ul>\nUnder the $SU(3)$ subgroup that fixes a chosen imaginary unit, these\nrepresentations decompose as\n\\[\n 7 \\;\\cong\\; 1 \\oplus 3 \\oplus \\bar{3}, \\qquad\n 14 \\;\\cong\\; 8 \\oplus 3 \\oplus \\bar{3},\n\\]\na pattern that already hints at colour-like structures.</p>\n<p>In other words, $G_2$ is the full continuous symmetry group of the\noctonionic number system itself.</p>\n<h3>Why ``minimal exceptional'' matters</h3>\n<p>As a Lie group, $G_2$ is:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>too small to host all Standard Model symmetries directly,\n <li>but large enough to control the essential nonassociative structure\n of $\\mathbb{O}$,\n <li>and exceptional — meaning it does not fit into the infinite $A_n$,\n $B_n$, $C_n$, $D_n$ series.\n</ul>\nThis makes $G_2$ an ideal starting point:\n<ul>\n <li>It is restrictive enough to strongly constrain internal operators.\n <li>It is flexible enough to embed subgroups that resemble the Standard Model structure\n $SU(3)_C\\times SU(2)_L\\times U(1)_Y$ in appropriate ways.\n <li>It naturally sits inside the larger exceptional group\n $F_4$, the automorphism group of the Albert algebra\n $H_3(\\mathbb{O})$.\n</ul>\n<h3>G$_2$ as a gatekeeper of allowed operators</h3>\n<p>In the model, internal operators (heptagon operator, radius operator,\nrotors, compressors) are not arbitrary matrices; they must be compatible\nwith the $G_2$ structure. Informally:</p>\n<blockquote>\n If an operator would break $G_2$ in an uncontrolled way, it is not part\n of the fundamental toolbox.\n</blockquote>\nThis has two important consequences:\n<ol>\n <li><strong>Restricted parameter space:</strong>\n many couplings and mass terms that are allowed in a generic\n field-theory Lagrangian are simply forbidden by $G_2$.\n <li><strong>Natural subgroups:</strong>\n gauge groups that actually appear (or approximate) in low-energy\n physics are required to arise as structurally compatible subgroups of $G_2$ (and later\n in $F_4$).\n</ol>\n<p>$G_2$ thus serves as a first filter between ``any algebraic\nconstruction on $\\mathbb{R}^8$'' and ``constructions that respect the\noctonionic number system''.</p>\n<h3>From G$_2$ to F$_4$</h3>\n<p>Later in the calendar, the Albert algebra $H_3(\\mathbb{O})$ will appear,\nand with it the larger exceptional group $F_4$:</p>\n<p>\\[\n F_4 = \\mathrm{Aut}\\big(H_3(\\mathbb{O})\\big).\n\\]\nThe relationship is hierarchical:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>$G_2$ controls the algebra of $\\mathbb{O}$ itself.\n <li>$H_3(\\mathbb{O})$ builds $3\\times3$ Hermitian matrices over\n $\\mathbb{O}$.\n <li>$F_4$ controls the automorphisms of this larger Jordan algebra $H_3(\\mathbb{O})$.\n</ul>\n<p>\\small\n\\begin{thebibliography}{9}</p>\n<p>\\bibitem{Engel1900}\nF.~Engel, ``Ein neues, dem linearen Komplexe analoges Gebilde,'' Ber.\\ Verh.\\ K\\\"onigl.\\ S\\\"achs.\\ Ges.\\ Wiss.\\ Leipzig 52, 63--74 (1900).</p>\n<p>\\bibitem{Bryant1987}\nR.~L.~Bryant, ``Metrics with exceptional holonomy,'' Ann.\\ Math. 126, 525--576 (1987).</p>\n<p>\\bibitem{Baez2002}\nJ.~C.~Baez, ``The octonions,'' Bull.\\ Amer.\\ Math.\\ Soc. 39, 145--205 (2002).</p>\n<p>\\end{thebibliography}\n\\normalsize</p>",

      "keyInsight": "<p>The seven imaginary octonion units can be arranged on a heptagon that encodes their multiplication rules. From this geometry one extracts three special numbers: the <em>heptagon eigenvalues</em> $(\\alpha_1,\\alpha_2,\\alpha_3)$. They arise as ratios of heptagon diagonals, satisfy a simple cubic equation, and are completely fixed by the shape of the regular heptagon. Later they will be used as the spectrum of a heptagon operator that feeds into coupling constants and mixing angles. Today we introduce these three numbers as a compact fingerprint of the sevenfold structure of $\\mathbb{O}$.</p>",
      "content": "<p>he octonions have seven imaginary units, and their multiplication rules can be visualised on an oriented heptagon — a Fano-type diagram that packages the entire nonassociative multiplication table into a single geometric picture. Hidden in this heptagon there is a simpler description: instead of seven separate directions, we can summarise the internal geometry by just three distinguished numbers.</p>\n<p>These three numbers will later appear as the eigenvalues of a <em>heptagon operator</em>: an octonionic linear operator whose action on a suitable three-dimensional subspace is completely described by that spectrum. For the Advent calendar, we do not need the full operator construction. What matters is that the heptagon geometry singles out a triple $(\\alpha_1,\\alpha_2,\\alpha_3)$ that already encodes the essential shape data.</p>\n<p>Why does this matter? Because $(\\alpha_1,\\alpha_2,\\alpha_3)$ will reappear throughout the calendar: in the construction of the radius operator $R$ and its spectrum $(a_0,b_0,c_0)$ (5 December), in geometric expressions for coupling constants such as the fine-structure constant $\\alpha$ and the strong coupling $\\alpha_s$, and in defining angles between rotor directions that enter the Weinberg angle $\\theta_W$. The heptagon eigenvalues are a compact <em>seed</em> from which many later observables can be grown.</p>\n<p>Conceptually, this marks the transition from combinatorial data — ``seven imaginary units on a heptagon'' — to spectral data that can be plugged into operators, potentials and eventually quantitative formulas. The heptagon eigenvalues are the first piece of the operator toolbox that will be fully assembled on the second Advent Sunday (7 December), alongside the radius operator, rotors, compressors and sign operators.</p>\n<p>The heptagon spectrum thus serves three roles at once:</p>\n<ol>\n <li><strong>Compression:</strong> seven directions are summarised by three eigenvalues.\n <li><strong>Invariance:</strong> $(\\alpha_1,\\alpha_2,\\alpha_3)$ are invariant under heptagon symmetries and $G_2$-compatible re-labellings—they are not artefacts of a particular basis choice.\n <li><strong>Spectral language:</strong> we move from basis-dependent multiplication tables to basis-independent spectral data, which is the natural language for later spectral geometry.\n</ol>\n<p>In short, the heptagon eigenvalues are the first place where the octonionic multiplication table starts to look like something a physicist would recognise as ``spectral parameters''. They turn abstract algebra into a small set of internal numbers that eventually manifest as physical constants.</p>\n<h3>Seven imaginary units on a heptagon</h3>\n<p>Octonions $\\mathbb{O}$ have seven imaginary units\n$e_1,\\dots,e_7$. Their multiplication can be depicted on an oriented\nheptagon: each directed edge (and certain chords) carries a triple\n$(e_i,e_j,e_k)$ with\n\\[\n e_i e_j = e_k,\\qquad\n e_j e_k = e_i,\\qquad\n e_k e_i = e_j,\n\\]\nand reversed order introduces a minus sign. This Fano-type diagram is more\nthan a mnemonic; it packages the nonassociative multiplication table into\na single geometric picture.</p>\n<h3>Heptagon geometry and diagonal ratios</h3>\n<p>A regular heptagon has not only seven vertices, but also several types of diagonals. If we fix its circumradius, then all edge lengths and diagonal lengths are pure shape data. In particular, there are three distinguished diagonal lengths, which we call $u, d, t$ like the French <em>un, deux, trois</em>. Starting at one vertex, we walk one, two, three vertices along the heptagon and eventually connect start and end point.</p>\n<p>From them we form three dimensionless ratios:\n\\[\n \\alpha_1 = \\frac{t}{d},\\qquad\n \\alpha_2 = -\\,\\frac{u}{t},\\qquad\n \\alpha_3 = \\frac{d}{-u}.\n\\]\nThey fulfill the elementary symmetric functions\n\\[\n S_1 = \\alpha_1 + \\alpha_2 + \\alpha_3 = -1, \\quad\n S_2 = -2, \\quad\n S_3 = \\alpha_1\\alpha_2\\alpha_3 = +1\n\\]\nso the triple $(\\alpha_1,\\alpha_2,\\alpha_3)$ is not arbitrary. These three numbers are completely fixed by the shape of the regular heptagon. They satisfy a simple cubic equation,\n\\[\n x^3 + x^2 - 2x - 1 = 0,\n\\]\nand its three real roots are exactly $\\alpha_1,\\alpha_2,\\alpha_3$.</p>\n<p>In other words: the combinatorial data ``seven vertices with their diagonals'' collapses to three pure shape invariants. They are the <em>heptagon eigenvalues</em> in geometric form.</p>\n<h3>From seven directions to three modes</h3>\n<p>The imaginary octonions span a seven-dimensional space. Each imaginary unit corresponds to a vertex of the heptagon. At first sight, one might think that all seven directions are independent.</p>\n<p>The heptagon geometry, however, tells us that there is a simpler description. When we look at patterns that respect the cyclic symmetry of the heptagon, seven directions naturally fall into three symmetry-adapted ``modes''. Exactly these three modes are quantified by the heptagon ratios $(\\alpha_1,\\alpha_2,\\alpha_3)$: they are the three characteristic values of how such a symmetry-adapted pattern ``spreads out'' along the heptagon.</p>\n<p>In more technical language, one can construct an octonionic linear operator whose action on these three modes is diagonal with eigenvalues $\\alpha_1,\\alpha_2,\\alpha_3$. The detailed construction is deferred to the main text; what matters here is the conceptual picture: a seven-dimensional internal space is encoded by three heptagon eigenvalues.</p>\n<h3>Why $(\\alpha_1,\\alpha_2,\\alpha_3)$ matter for physics</h3>\n<p>Later in the calendar, $(\\alpha_1,\\alpha_2,\\alpha_3)$ will reappear in several\ncontexts:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>In the construction of the <em>radius operator</em> $R$ and its\n spectrum $(a_0,b_0,c_0)$ (tomorrow).\n <li>In geometric expressions for coupling constants, such as the\n fine-structure constant $\\alpha$ and the strong coupling\n $\\alpha_s$.\n <li>In defining angles between rotor directions that enter the\n Weinberg angle $\\theta_W$.\n</ul>\n<p>In other words, the heptagon eigenvalues are a compact <em>seed</em> from\nwhich many later observables can be grown.

Far from a\n nuisance, this failure of associativity can be measured by the\n <em>associator</em>, and its norm feeds directly into the size of\n hierarchies. In the octonionic model, the huge gaps between electron\n and top mass, or between Planck and electroweak scales, are not\n independent miracles: they are controlled by how strongly the internal\n multiplication fails to be associative in selected directions.</p>",
      "content": "<h3>Associativity lost, structure gained</h3>\n<p>n the complex numbers and quaternions we have\n\\[\n (ab)c = a(bc)\n \\quad\\text{for all }a,b,c.\n\\]\nFor octonions $\\mathbb{O}$ this is no longer true. The deviation is\ncaptured by the <em>associator</em>\n\\[\n [a,b,c] := (ab)c - a(bc).\n\\]\nNonassociativity means $[a,b,c]\\neq0$ for suitable triples $(a,b,c)$.</p>\n<p>At first sight this looks like a technical complication. But in an\noperator-based model, $[a,b,c]$ is a structured quantity whose norm can\nbe used as a measure of ``how curved'' the internal multiplication is in a\ngiven region of the algebra.</p>\n<h3>Associator norms as hierarchy seeds</h3>\n<p>The key idea is simple:</p>\n<blockquote>\n Strong nonassociativity (large $||[a,b,c]||$) correlates with\n <em>large</em> hierarchies; near-associative directions correspond to\n <em>small</em> gaps.\n</blockquote>\n<p>Schematically, for suitable triples $(a,b,c)$ associated with sectors\nof the internal space, one can write\n\\[\n \\text{hierarchy factor} \\;\\sim\\;\n \\exp\\!\\bigl(\\gamma\\,\\|[a,b,c]\\|\\bigr),\n\\]\nwith a model-dependent constant $\\gamma$. Large associator norms then\nnaturally give exponentials of order $10^{10}$ or $10^{30}$—exactly the\nkind of huge ratios seen between Planck and electroweak scales, or between\nelectron and top mass.</p>\n<h3>Flat vs.\\ curved internal directions</h3>\n<p>Not all directions in $\\mathbb{O}$ are equally nonassociative:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>Quaternion subalgebras inside $\\mathbb{O}$ are associative:\n $[a,b,c]=0$ whenever $a,b,c$ lie in the same quaternionic\n subalgebra. These are ``flat'' directions.\n <li>Triples that genuinely probe the full octonionic structure\n typically have $[a,b,c]\\neq0$. These are ``curved'' directions.\n</ul>\n<p>This suggests a qualitative picture:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>Light fermions and low-energy scales live predominantly in almost\n quaternionic (nearly associative) directions.\n <li>Heavy fermions and high-energy scales probe strongly octonionic\n (strongly nonassociative) directions.\n</ul>\n<p>The associator becomes a geometric dial between ``light'' and ``heavy''.</p>\n<h3>From internal curvature to physical gaps</h3>\n<p>In curved spacetime geometry, curvature scalars control focusing of\ngeodesics and tidal forces. In the octonionic internal geometry, the\nassociator norm plays an analogous role:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>It tells us how violently internal products deviate from the\n naive, associative expectation.\n <li>Through the operator toolbox (rotors, compressors, radius\n operator), this deviation feeds into eigenvalue spectra and hence\n into physical scales and masses.\n</ul>\n<p>Symbolically one can write\n\\[\n m_{\\text{heavy}}/m_{\\text{light}}\n \\;\\sim\\; F\\bigl(\\|[a,b,c]\\|\\bigr),\n\\]\nfor some monotone function $F$ determined by the detailed embedding in\n$H_3(\\mathbb{O})$.</p>\n<h3>Why this matters conceptually</h3>\n<p>The nonassociativity day adds an important layer to the Advent story:</p>\n<ol>\n <li>It explains why large hierarchies are <em>allowed</em> and\n <em>natural</em> in an octonionic setting: they are the rule, not\n the exception, once associativity is dropped.\n <li>It connects an abstract algebraic property—failure of\n associativity—to directly observable quantities: mass ratios and\n scale separations.\n <li>It sharpens the contrast with associative models, where such large\n gaps often have to be enforced by hand via fine-tuned potentials\n or additional symmetries.\n</ol>\n<p>If future work can make this link between associator norms and concrete\nhierarchies numerically sharp, nonassociativity would move from a curious\nmathematical footnote to a central player in explaining why the physical\nworld has the extreme scales we observe.</p>\n<p>\\small\n\\begin{thebibliography}{9}</p>\n<p>\\bibitem{Schafer1966}\nR.~D.~Schafer,\n\\newblock {\\em An Introduction to Nonassociative Algebras},\n\\newblock Academic Press, 1966.</p>\n<p>\\bibitem{Baez2002}\nJ.~C.~Baez,\n\\newblock ``The octonions,''\n\\newblock {\\em Bull.\\ Amer.\\ Math.\\ Soc.} <strong>39</strong>, 145--205 (2002).</p>\n<p>\\bibitem{Internal}\n[Internal notes on hierarchy patterns and associators, see\n{\\tt chap02\\_neu.tex; chap05\\_neu.tex}.]</p>\n<p>\\end{thebibliography}\n\\normalsize</p>",

      "content": "<h3>From mysterious constant to geometric norm</h3>\n<p>ew numbers in physics have attracted as much fascination\nas the fine-structure constant,\n\\[\n \\alpha \\;=\\; \\frac{e^2}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0\\hbar c}\n \\;\\approx\\; \\frac{1}{137.035999\\ldots}.\n\\]\nHistorically, $\\alpha$ enters quantum electrodynamics as a dimensionless\ncoupling: it controls the strength of electromagnetic interactions and\nthe convergence of perturbation theory. For decades, it has been treated\nas a parameter to be measured, not derived.</p>\n<p>In the octonionic model, $\\alpha$ is no longer a free parameter. It\nappears as the squared norm of a commutator built from internal\n<em>rotors</em> in the exceptional geometry. The value of $\\alpha$ is\ntied to how certain planes inside the octonionic/Albert algebra are\noriented with respect to each other.</p>\n<h3>Internal rotors and commutators</h3>\n<p>The internal space of the model is not a simple Lie algebra like\n$\\mathfrak{su}(2)$ or $\\mathfrak{su}(3)$ in isolation. Instead, it sits\ninside the exceptional Lie algebra associated with the Albert algebra\n$H_3(\\mathbb{O})$ and its symmetry group $F_4$.</p>\n<p>Within this setting, one considers special operators $R_a$, $R_b$, \\dots,\nwhich act as <em>rotors</em> on selected internal subspaces. Schematically,\none writes\n\\[\n R_a \\;\\sim\\; \\exp(\\theta_a X_a),\n \\qquad\n R_b \\;\\sim\\; \\exp(\\theta_b X_b),\n\\]\nwhere $X_a$, $X_b$ are generators associated with particular internal\ndirections (for instance, those tied to weak isospin and hypercharge).</p>\n<p>The key object is the commutator\n\\[\n [R_a, R_b]\n \\;\\approx\\;\n \\theta_a\\theta_b [X_a,X_b]\n\\]\nin an appropriate small-angle limit. The <em>norm</em> of this commutator\ndefines an effective coupling:\n\\[\n \\alpha \\;\\propto\\; \\bigl\\|[R_a,R_b]\\bigr\\|^2.\n\\]\nChoosing $R_a$ and $R_b$ according to the embedding of $U(1)_{\\text{em}}$\ninside the internal algebra singles out the electromagnetic coupling.</p>\n<h3>From abstract norm to a concrete number</h3>\n<p>The statement that $\\alpha$ is given by a squared norm would be empty if\nthe norm could be tuned at will. The nontrivial part is that in the\noctonionic/Albert setting the relevant rotors are highly constrained:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>Triality and $G_2$-compatibility fix how vector and spinor\n directions in $\\mathbb{R}^8$ are related.\n <li>The Jordan structure of $H_3(\\mathbb{O})$ restricts which\n combinations of internal directions can appear as ``legal''\n rotors.\n <li>The vacuum configuration $\\langle H\\rangle$ selects preferred\n eigen-directions and thereby preferred planes in which the\n rotors act.\n</ul>\n<p>Under these constraints, the norm $\\bigl\\|[R_a,R_b]\\bigr\\|^2$ is not a\ncontinuously tunable parameter. It falls into discrete bands determined\nby the eigenvalues of certain internal projectors and compressor\noperators. One of these bands lands numerically in the vicinity of\n$1/137$, and this is identified with the observed fine-structure\nconstant at a particular reference scale.</p>\n<h3>Relations to strong and weak couplings</h3>\n<p>The same construction can be repeated for other choices of rotors:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>Rotors associated with the $SU(3)$ color directions lead to an\n effective strong coupling $\\alpha_s$.\n <li>Rotors associated with the weak isospin and hypercharge mixture\n lead to $\\sin^2\\theta_W$, the weak mixing angle.\n</ul>\n<p>The guiding principle is that <em>all</em> gauge couplings arise as norms\nof commutators of rotors in the same internal algebra. This leads to\nrelations of the symbolic form\n\\[\n \\alpha \\;\\sim\\; \\|[R_{\\text{em}},R_{\\text{ref}}]\\|^2,\n \\qquad\n \\alpha_s \\;\\sim\\; \\|[R_{\\text{color}},R_{\\text{ref}}]\\|^2,\n \\qquad\n \\sin^2\\theta_W \\;\\sim\\; \\|[R_{\\text{weak}},R_{\\text{ref}}]\\|^2,\n\\]\nwhere $R_{\\text{ref}}$ is a common reference rotor set by the vacuum\nconfiguration in $H_3(\\mathbb{O})$.</p>\n<p>In this picture, the observed pattern of couplings is a fingerprint of\nhow the vacuum sits inside the exceptional algebra, not a list of\nindependent constants.</p>\n<h3>Scaling and running</h3>\n<p>Of course, $\\alpha$ is not a rigid number: in quantum field theory it\nruns with energy scale. The octonionic model does not deny this; instead\nit separates two roles:</p>\n<ol>\n <li>The <em>bare geometric value</em>, determined by the internal\n rotor norm at a natural reference scale.\n <li>The <em>renormalized value</em> seen in experiments at a given\n energy, obtained by standard running from that reference scale.\n</ol>\n<p>The contribution of the geometry is to fix the starting point and the\nrelative pattern of couplings. The quantum field theoretic machinery of\nrunning and thresholds then dresses these values to the ones we measure.</p>\n<h3>A different attitude towards constants</h3>\n<p>If $\\alpha$ comes from an internal rotor norm, then the traditional\nquestion ``Why $1/137$\\,?'' shifts its focus. Instead of asking for a\nclosed-form expression in terms of $\\pi$ and $e$ alone, we ask:</p>\n<blockquote>\n Why does the vacuum select exactly this arrangement of internal\n directions in the exceptional algebra?\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, the mystery moves from ``a magic number'' to\n``a specific geometric configuration''. This may or may not be more\nsatisfying philosophically, but it is technically more tractable: one\ncan compute norms of commutators, study their spectra, and connect them\nto the attractor dynamics discussed later in the Advent series.</p>\n<p>\\small\n\\begin{thebibliography}{9}</p>\n<p>\\bibitem{Dyson1968}\nF.~Dyson,\n\\newblock ``The role of the fine-structure constant in physics,''\n\\newblock {\\em American Journal of Physics} <strong>58</strong>, 209--211 (1968).</p>\n<p>\\bibitem{Furey2018}\nC.~Furey,\n\\newblock ``$SU(3)_C \\times SU(2)_L \\times U(1)_Y$ from division algebras,''\n\\newblock {\\em Phys.\\ Lett.\\ B} <strong>785</strong>, 84--89 (2018).</p>\n<p>\\bibitem{GurseyTze1996}\nF.~Gürsey and H.~C.~Tze,\n\\newblock {\\em On the Role of Division, Jordan and Related Algebras in Particle\nPhysics},\n\\newblock World Scientific, 1996.</p>\n<p>\\end{thebibliography}\n\\normalsize</p>",

The three triality-related irreducible\n representations --- vector, left-handed spinor, right-handed spinor ---\n are read as three coherent ways of organizing the same internal data.\n When this structure is embedded into the Albert algebra, it naturally\n unfolds into three fermion generations with correlated mass and mixing\n patterns.</p>",
      "content": "<h3>The puzzle of three generations</h3>\n<p>he Standard Model contains three generations of quarks and\nleptons. They have identical gauge quantum numbers but very different masses\nand mixings. From the perspective of the usual gauge-group story this is a\nmystery: why not one generation, or five, or an arbitrary number?</p>\n<p>Most approaches simply accept three generations as an experimental fact and\nadd family indices. The octonionic model takes a different route. It asks\nwhether the number three could arise from the internal representation theory\nof the exceptional structures that underlie the model.</p>\n<p>The key player is the triality of $\\mathrm{Spin}(8)$ and its embedding into\nthe Albert algebra $H_3(\\mathbb{O})$.</p>\n<h3>Spin(8) and triality</h3>\n<p>The group $\\mathrm{Spin}(8)$, the double cover of $\\mathrm{SO}(8)$, has an\nexceptional property: it possesses three inequivalent eight-dimensional\nirreducible representations,\n\\[\n V_8,\\qquad S_8^+,\\qquad S_8^-,\n\\]\nusually called the vector, left-handed spinor, and right-handed spinor\nrepresentations. An outer automorphism of $\\mathrm{Spin}(8)$ permutes these\nthree representations. This is the triality symmetry.</p>\n<p>In abstract group theory, triality is often presented as a curiosity of\nDynkin type $D_4$. In the present model it is taken seriously as structural\ninput:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>We start from <em>one</em> internal eight-dimensional block, not three\n unrelated ones.\n <li>We insist that this block can be read in three coherent ways:\n as $V_8$, as $S_8^+$, and as $S_8^-$.\n <li>The consistency of these three readings constrains how internal\n operators can act.\n</ul>\n<p>This ``one block, three readings'' principle will later be matched to the\nthree observed fermion generations.</p>\n<h3>From octonions to the Albert algebra</h3>\n<p>The internal degrees of freedom of the model are organised using the Albert\nalgebra $H_3(\\mathbb{O})$, the Jordan algebra of $3\\times 3$ hermitian\noctonionic matrices. Its automorphism group is the exceptional Lie group\n$F_4$:\n\\[\n F_4 \\;=\\; \\mathrm{Aut}\\bigl(H_3(\\mathbb{O})\\bigr).\n\\]</p>\n<p>Within $H_3(\\mathbb{O})$, each diagonal entry can be associated with an\noctonionic ``slot'' hosting an internal Spin(8) structure. Roughly\nspeaking:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>One diagonal octonion slot is associated with the vector\n representation.\n <li>The second diagonal slot carries a left-handed spinor structure.\n <li>The third diagonal slot carries a right-handed spinor structure.\n</ul>\n<p>Triality then manifests itself as a structured permutation of these roles,\nimplemented by elements of $F_4$ that reshuffle the internal directions in a\ncontrolled way.</p>\n<h3>Reading generations from triality sectors</h3>\n<p>When we couple the internal $H_3(\\mathbb{O})$ structure to the spacetime\nDirac operator and the mass map $\\Pi(H)$, each triality sector produces a\nfamily of fermionic modes. Schematicly:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>The <em>vector-like</em> reading of the internal block organises one\n set of states with a characteristic mass pattern.\n <li>The <em>left-handed spinor</em> reading gives rise to a second set\n of states, with masses related but not identical to the first set.\n <li>The <em>right-handed spinor</em> reading yields a third set, again\n correlated but distinct.\n</ul>\n<p>These three correlated sets are identified with the three fermion\ngenerations. The crucial point is not that there are exactly three\nrepresentations, but that they are related by an <em>outer</em> automorphism:\nthey are three faces of one internal object, not three arbitrary copies.</p>\n<h3>Constraints on mass and mixing patterns</h3>\n<p>Because the three generations arise from a single internal block with\ntriality symmetry, their mass and mixing parameters cannot be chosen\nindependently. Several qualitative features follow:</p>\n<ol>\n <li><strong>Hierarchy:</strong> The eigenvalues of the mass map $\\Pi(H)$, when\n restricted to the three triality-related sectors, typically split\n into bands with a built-in hierarchy. This echoes the observed\n pattern of light, medium, and heavy generations.\n<li><strong>Mixing structure:</strong> The allowed off-diagonal couplings\n between triality sectors are constrained by the Jordan structure of\n $H_3(\\mathbb{O})$ and the embedding of the Standard Model gauge\n group. This shapes the form of the CKM and PMNS matrices.\n<li><strong>Stability:</strong> Because the three generations share a common\n internal origin, small deformations of the vacuum configuration\n $\\langle H\\rangle$ tend to move all three in a correlated way,\n rather than producing arbitrary new families.\n</ol>\n<p>The goal is not to ``explain every digit'' of the mass spectrum, but to\nshow that three generations with a hierarchical and mixing-rich structure\nare the <em>natural</em> outcome of the exceptional geometry.</p>\n<h3>Comparison with ad hoc family replication</h3>\n<p>In more conventional settings, one starts from a gauge group and then\nadds three copies of the fermion content:\n\\[\n \\psi \\;\\longrightarrow\\; (\\psi^{(1)},\\psi^{(2)},\\psi^{(3)}),\n\\]\nwith a family index labelling generations. This move works phenomenologically,\nbut it does not tell us why there are three copies, nor why their masses\nare ordered the way we see them.</p>\n<p>The octonionic approach reverses the logic:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>Start from a single octonionic/Spin(8) block with triality.\n <li>Embed it into an exceptional algebra ($H_3(\\mathbb{O})$ with $F_4$\n symmetry).\n <li>Let the internal mass map and vacuum pick out three correlated\n triality sectors.\n</ul>\n<p>Family replication is not assumed; it is read off from the structure of\nthe internal algebra.</p>\n<p>\\small\n\\begin{thebibliography}{9}</p>\n<p>\\bibitem{Baez2002}\nJ.~C.~Baez,\n\\newblock ``The octonions,''\n\\newblock {\\em Bull.\\ Amer.\\ Math.\\ Soc.} <strong>39</strong>, 145--205 (2002).</p>\n<p>\\bibitem{GurseyTze1996}\nF.~Gürsey and H.~C.~Tze,\n\\newblock {\\em On the Role of Division, Jordan and Related Algebras in Particle\nPhysics},\n\\newblock World Scientific, 1996.</p>\n<p>\\bibitem{Ramond2010}\nP.~Ramond,\n\\newblock {\\em Group Theory: A Physicist's Survey},\n\\newblock Cambridge University Press, 2010.</p>\n<p>\\end{thebibliography}\n\\normalsize</p>",

The pattern of mixings is constrained by how the\n mass map, flavor projectors and compressor operators fit together in\n the exceptional geometry.</p>",
      "content": "<h3>Two mysterious unitary matrices</h3>\n<p>he Standard Model describes quark and lepton mixings by\ntwo unitary matrices:\n\\[\n V_{\\text{CKM}} \\quad\\text{for quarks},\\qquad\n U_{\\text{PMNS}} \\quad\\text{for leptons}.\n\\]\nEmpirically, $V_{\\text{CKM}}$ is close to the identity with small off-diagonal\nelements, while $U_{\\text{PMNS}}$ shows large mixings between neutrino\nflavors. In the usual formulation, both matrices are introduced by hand\nwhen diagonalising Yukawa matrices. They are indispensable in\nphenomenology, but their structure appears accidental.</p>\n<p>The octonionic model offers a different viewpoint. It treats mixing angles\nand phases not as arbitrary complex numbers, but as geometric data attached\nto how different preferred bases in the exceptional internal space\nintersect.</p>\n<h3>The internal atlas picture</h3>\n<p>The internal degrees of freedom live in the Albert algebra $H_3(\\mathbb{O})$,\nwith automorphism group $F_4$. On this space, several distinguished\noperators are defined:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>The <em>mass map</em> $\\Pi(H)$, built from a vacuum configuration\n $\\langle H\\rangle$, whose eigenvectors encode mass eigenstates.\n <li><em>Flavor projectors</em> which single out quark-like and\n lepton-like subspaces.\n <li><em>Compressor</em> and <em>rotor</em> operators that encode hierarchies\n and couplings.\n</ul>\n<p>Different physical questions prefer different eigenbases:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>Gauge interactions ``see'' eigenbases aligned with flavor projectors.\n <li>Mass measurements ``see'' eigenbases of $\\Pi(H)$.\n</ul>\n<p>The resulting misalignment between these bases is what phenomenologists\ncall ``mixing''. In the geometric language, it is nothing but a transition\nmap between charts on the internal space.</p>\n<h3>CKM as a transition map in the quark sector</h3>\n<p>Focus first on the quark sector. Consider two orthonormal bases of the\nrelevant internal subspace:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>$\\{\\,|d_i\\rangle\\,\\}$, $i=1,2,3$, adapted to flavor (interaction)\n eigenstates: these diagonalise the couplings to $W^\\pm$ and gluons.\n <li>$\\{\\,|d_i'\\rangle\\,\\}$, $i=1,2,3$, adapted to mass eigenstates:\n these diagonalise the restriction of $\\Pi(H)$ to the down-type quark\n sector.\n</ul>\n<p>By definition, there exists a unitary matrix $V_{\\text{CKM}}$ such that\n\\[\n |d_i\\rangle \\;=\\; \\sum_j (V_{\\text{CKM}})_{ij}\\,|d_j'\\rangle.\n\\]\nIn the octonionic setting, both bases arise from eigenproblems for\noperators that live in the same exceptional algebra and are constrained by\nits structure. As a result:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>The allowed pattern of overlaps $(V_{\\text{CKM}})_{ij}$ is not\n arbitrary; some entries are naturally suppressed or enhanced.\n <li>Small quark mixing angles become a consequence of how the quark\n flavor projectors and the mass map almost commute within the\n relevant subspace of $H_3(\\mathbb{O})$.\n</ul>\n<p>The hierarchical structure of $V_{\\text{CKM}}$ thus reflects an almost\ncompatible choice of charts in the internal atlas.</p>\n<h3>PMNS and the special role of neutrinos</h3>\n<p>For leptons, the situation is different. The PMNS matrix connects charged\nlepton mass eigenstates to neutrino flavor eigenstates. In many models,\nneutrinos are Majorana particles with a mass matrix that has a different\norigin from the charged lepton masses.</p>\n<p>In the octonionic model, this difference is encoded in the way neutrino\ndirections sit inside $H_3(\\mathbb{O})$:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>Neutrino-like internal directions may be associated with subspaces\n that are more strongly affected by nonassociative chains in the\n octonionic structure.\n <li>The corresponding projectors onto neutrino subspaces can fail to\n commute more strongly with the mass map and with certain rotor\n operators.\n</ul>\n<p>As a result, the overlap matrix $U_{\\text{PMNS}}$ between flavor and mass\neigenbases for leptons can naturally have large off-diagonal entries: the\nrelevant operators pick eigenbases that are more misaligned than in the\nquark case.</p>\n<h3>Qualitative patterns from exceptional constraints</h3>\n<p>The goal of the octonionic approach is not to predict every mixing angle\nand phase numerically from first principles in a single stroke.

      "content": "<h3>From symbols to numbers</h3>\n<p>o far, the exceptional structures have been presented in\na largely symbolic way: octonions, the Albert algebra $H_3(\\mathbb{O})$, the\nmass map $\\Pi(H)$ and its relation to vacuum configurations $\\langle H\\rangle$.\nAt some point, however, the model must leave the realm of pure algebra and\nproduce numbers that can be compared, at least qualitatively, to particle\nphysics.</p>\n<p>The good news is that this can already be done with remarkably simple\nchoices of $\\langle H\\rangle$. By freezing most degrees of freedom and\nretaining only a few dominant internal directions, one obtains toy vacua\nthat are simple enough to diagonalise exactly, but rich enough to display\nhierarchical spectra.</p>\n<h3>Diagonal prototype vacua</h3>\n<p>The cleanest starting point is a diagonal configuration in $H_3(\\mathbb{O})$:\n\\[\n \\langle H\\rangle\n \\;=\\;\n \\begin{pmatrix}\n \\lambda_1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n 0 & \\lambda_2 & 0 \\\\\n 0 & 0 & \\lambda_3\n \\end{pmatrix},\n \\qquad\n \\lambda_i \\in \\mathbb{R}.\n\\]\nSuch a vacuum preserves a maximal amount of internal symmetry: off-diagonal\noctonionic entries are set to zero, and only three real parameters remain.\nDespite this simplicity, the induced mass map\n\\[\n \\Pi(\\langle H\\rangle) : \\mathcal{H}_{\\text{int}} \\longrightarrow \\mathcal{H}_{\\text{int}}\n\\]\nalready exhibits a nontrivial eigenvalue structure.</p>\n<p>In the eigenvalue problem\n\\[\n \\Pi(\\langle H\\rangle)\\,\\Psi = m\\,\\Psi,\n\\]\nthe internal Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}_{\\text{int}}$ decomposes into\nsectors that correspond to quark-like and lepton-like states, coloured and\ncolourless states, left- and right-handed components, and so on. Each\nsector contributes a set of eigenvalues $m$.</p>\n<p>For suitable choices of $(\\lambda_1,\\lambda_2,\\lambda_3)$ one observes:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>Eigenvalues cluster into a few <em>bands</em>, separated by gaps.\n <li>Within each band, degeneracies and small splittings appear, induced\n by the residual internal symmetry.\n <li>The overall pattern can be read as ``light, medium, heavy'' families,\n evocative of the observed hierarchy between generations.\n</ul>\n<h3>Off-diagonal perturbations and splitting patterns</h3>\n<p>To go beyond the simplest diagonal picture, one can add controlled\noff-diagonal octonionic entries to $\\langle H\\rangle$:\n\\[\n \\langle H\\rangle\n \\;=\\;\n \\begin{pmatrix}\n \\lambda_1 & x & 0 \\\\\n \\bar{x} & \\lambda_2 & y \\\\\n 0 & \\bar{y} & \\lambda_3\n \\end{pmatrix},\n \\qquad\n x,y \\in \\mathbb{O}.\n\\]\nEven when $x$ and $y$ are chosen along a single imaginary octonion unit,\nthe eigenvalue structure of $\\Pi(\\langle H\\rangle)$ changes qualitatively:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>Degenerate bands split into sub-bands.\n <li>Some states are pushed up or down in mass, mimicking the effect of\n mixing between different internal directions.\n <li>Eigenvectors acquire nontrivial support across different\n triality-related components, foreshadowing the mixing phenomena\n associated with CKM and PMNS matrices.\n</ul>\n<p>These controlled deformations are the ``numerical workhorses'' of the\nmodel: they allow us to scan how the spectrum responds when the vacuum\nis moved inside $H_3(\\mathbb{O})$.</p>\n<h3>Prototype spectra and their interpretation</h3>\n<p>The resulting eigenvalue sets are not yet to be interpreted as precise\npredictions for Standard Model fermion masses. Instead, they serve as\n<em>prototypes</em> that illustrate what the exceptional machinery tends to\nproduce generically:</p>\n<ol>\n <li><strong>Banded hierarchies:</strong> eigenvalues group into bands with\n ratios that are naturally large or small, depending on how many\n internal directions contribute coherently.\n <li><strong>Sector-dependent patterns:</strong> quark-like and lepton-like\n sectors display different splitting patterns, reflecting their\n different embedding in the internal algebra.\n <li><strong>Robustness under deformation:</strong> certain qualitative\n hierarchies persist under a wide range of small changes in\n $(\\lambda_1,\\lambda_2,\\lambda_3,x,y)$, suggesting that they are\n structural rather than fine-tuned.\n</ol>\n<p>From this perspective, the complicated observed mass spectrum is seen as\none point in a structured space of possible spectra generated by the\noctonionic geometry.</p>\n<h3>The role of the Ersatzbank</h3>\n<p>Within the larger Advent project, these numerical prototypes form an\n``Ersatzbank'' of ready-made examples:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>They can be used to replace more philosophical or qualitative\n discussion days by concrete numerical sheets.\n <li>They demonstrate to the reader that the abstract constructions\n genuinely lead to computable spectra with clear patterns.\n <li>They provide anchor points for later, more refined fits where\n the parameters of $\\langle H\\rangle$ and the definition of\n $\\Pi(H)$ are tuned to approximate real-world data.\n</ul>\n<p>In teaching or outreach contexts, such an Ersatzbank is particularly\nvaluable: it allows one to show explicit tables of ``eigenvalues from an\nexceptional universe'' without requiring the audience to follow every\ntechnical step.</p>\n<h3>An invitation to explore</h3>\n<p>Technically, numerical exploration of $\\Pi(\\langle H\\rangle)$ is\nstraightforward: once a concrete basis for $H_3(\\mathbb{O})$ and the\nrelevant operators is chosen, the problem reduces to diagonalising large\nbut structured matrices. Modern linear algebra libraries can handle this\ncomfortably.</p>\n<p>Conceptually, the challenge is to interpret the resulting patterns in a\nway that respects both the algebraic symmetries and the phenomenological\nconstraints. The prototypes presented here are first steps in that\ndirection: they show that the exceptional machinery is capable of\nproducing spectra that look qualitatively like what one expects from\nquark and lepton masses, without any artificial ``by hand'' hierarchies\ninserted into the Lagrangian.</p>\n<p>\\small\n\\begin{thebibliography}{9}</p>\n<p>\\bibitem{GurseyTze1996}\nF.~Gürsey and H.~C.~Tze,\n\\newblock {\\em On the Role of Division, Jordan and Related Algebras in Particle\nPhysics},\n\\newblock World Scientific, 1996.</p>\n<p>\\bibitem{Baez2002}\nJ.~C.~Baez,\n\\newblock ``The octonions,''\n\\newblock {\\em Bull.\\ Amer.\\ Math.\\ Soc.} <strong>39</strong>, 145--205 (2002).</p>\n<p>\\bibitem{ConnesMarcolli2008}\nA.~Connes and M.~Marcolli,\n\\newblock {\\em Noncommutative Geometry, Quantum Fields and Motives},\n\\newblock American Mathematical Society, 2008.</p>\n<p>\\end{thebibliography}\n\\normalsize</p>",

      "content": "<h3>How much is already covered</h3>\n<p>efore talking about what is missing, it is worth\nrecalling what is already under octonionic control:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>Internal quantum numbers are organised on an exceptional stage\n ($\\mathbb{O}$, $H_3(\\mathbb{O})$, $G_2$, $F_4$).\n <li>Couplings and mixing angles appear as norms and angles of rotor\n commutators.\n <li>Fermion masses and flavour structure arise as spectra of\n compressors derived from a vacuum $\\langle H\\rangle$.\n <li>Characteristic energy scales (Planck, electroweak, QCD) are linked\n to invariants of the radius operator and attractor mechanisms.\n</ul>\n<p>Within this internal sector, the story is fairly coherent: many quantities\nthat used to be independent inputs become different faces of the same\nexceptional geometry.</p>\n<h3>Enter gravity: a separate constant</h3>\n<p>Gravitation is encoded in general relativity by Newton's constant $G$, or,\nmore conveniently, by the Planck mass\n\\[\n m_P = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar c}{G}}.\n\\]\nThe proton mass $m_p$ then defines a dimensionless ratio\n\\[\n \\kappa = \\frac{m_p}{m_P},\n\\]\nnumerically of order $10^{-19}$.</p>\n<p>In the present octonionic framework, $m_p$ is accessible in principle via\nthe compressor structure (it is one of the low-lying eigenvalues of the\nmass map), but $m_P$ is not yet derived: it is imported from gravitational\nphysics.

But conceptually it\nmatters:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>Internally, the model claims a structural explanation of many\n numbers (charges, couplings, fermion masses).\n <li>Externally, gravity fixes the overall scale at which quantum\n fields backreact on spacetime.\n</ul>\n<p>Without a link between the internal exceptional geometry and spacetime\ngeometry, the story is incomplete: we know how fields behave on a given\nbackground, but we do not yet explain how that background itself emerges\nfrom the same algebraic structure.</p>\n<h3>Spectral geometry as the natural bridge</h3>\n<p>There is, however, a natural candidate framework to close this gap:\n<em>spectral geometry</em>. Instead of describing spacetime by a metric\n$g_{\\mu\\nu}$, one describes it by a Dirac operator $D$ on a suitable\nHilbert space. The spectral action principle then postulates an action\n\\[\n S_{\\text{spec}} = \\mathrm{Tr}\\,f(D^2/\\Lambda^2),\n\\]\nwhose heat-kernel expansion generates:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>the Einstein--Hilbert term (gravity),\n <li>a cosmological constant term,\n <li>gauge and matter kinetic terms,\n <li>and higher-order corrections.\n</ul>\n<p>In the octonionic context, the hope is clear:</p>\n<blockquote>\n Build a Dirac operator $D$ that encodes both spacetime geometry and the\n internal octonionic/Albert structure, then read gravitational couplings\n and the scale $\\Lambda$ from its spectrum.\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the language of this project, such a Dirac operator $D$ is not an\nadd-on but the same master operator that already organises the internal\nrotors, compressors and mass maps. Later in the calendar, this idea\nwill be made explicit in the form of a single master action $S[D,\\Psi]$\nthat packages internal and gravitational dynamics into one object.\nHere, we only flag this direction; the actual construction is deferred.</p>\n<p>This would turn $G$, $\\kappa$ and even aspects of dark energy into\nspectral invariants of the same operator that already knows about internal\nrotors and compressors.</p>\n<h3>What is missing right now</h3>\n<p>The present model does <em>not</em> yet provide a final construction of such\na Dirac operator. Concretely:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>The exact Hilbert space on which $D$ acts, combining spacetime\n spinors with octonionic internal data, has not been fixed.\n <li>The interplay between nonassociative internal multiplication and\n the standard differential-geometric structure of $D$ is not yet\n fully understood.\n <li>The computation that would derive $\\kappa$ from the spectrum of\n $D$ is not available; $\\kappa$ is treated as known input.\n</ul>\n<p>This is why gravity is called the ``missing corner'': it is not absent\nbecause it does not fit, but because the necessary spectral-geometric\nmachinery has not yet been fully built.</p>\n<h3>Why it is still worth taking the model seriously</h3>\n<p>Admitting an open gravitational block is not a weakness of honesty; it is\na strength of design:</p>\n<ol>\n <li>It clearly marks where the current octonionic explanations end and\n where new ideas are needed.\n <li>It suggests a concrete research programme rather than a vague hope:\n construct an octonionic spectral triple and compute the resulting\n gravitational sector.\n <li>It prevents overclaiming: the model explains many things about\n internal structure, but it does not pretend to have solved quantum\n gravity.\n</ol>\n<p>Seen this way, the gravitational day of the Advent calendar is less a\nconclusion than a pointer: it ties the exceptional internal geometry to\nthe next natural step in modern mathematical physics.</p>\n<h3>A clear boundary, not a blind spot</h3>\n<p>The main message of this sheet is thus intentionally simple:</p>\n<blockquote>\n The octonionic model currently stops at the boundary of gravity. The\n ratio $\\kappa = m_p/m_P$ is acknowledged as an external input, and a\n spectral-gravity extension is needed to pull it inside the algebraic\n story, eventually in the form of a unified action $S[D,\\Psi]$ whose\ngravitational coefficients are fixed by the same spectral data as the\ninternal ones.\n</blockquote>\n<p>The rest of the calendar—especially the spectral-geometry and AQFT days—\nshows that this next step is plausible, but it is not taken yet.

Hilbert\nspace, canonical commutation relations and perturbative expansions are\nbaked in from the start.</p>\n<p>Algebraic QFT (Haag--Kastler) takes a different route. The basic object is\na net of C$^*$- or von Neumann algebras\n\\[\n \\mathcal{O} \\longmapsto \\mathcal{A}(\\mathcal{O}),\n\\]\nwhere $\\mathcal{O}$ runs over open regions of spacetime.

AQFT\noffers exactly the right viewpoint:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>The internal nonassociative structure influences which operators\n can be multiplied and localised, but the algebras themselves\n remain associative operator algebras.\n <li>Different vacuum choices (different $\\omega$) lead to different\n Hilbert-space representations, without changing the underlying\n net $\\mathcal{A}(\\mathcal{O})$.\n</ul>\n<h3>Octonionic local algebras</h3>\n<p>In an octonionic context, one can sketch the following assignment:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>To each spacetime region $\\mathcal{O}$ we assign an algebra\n $\\mathcal{A}(\\mathcal{O})$ generated by:\n <ul>\n <li>localised rotor operators (internal symmetries),\n <li>compressor fields encoding mass/mixing effects,\n <li>fluctuation modes of the Jordan element $H$.\n </ul>\n <li>These generators satisfy commutation relations constrained by the\n exceptional symmetry ($G_2$, $F_4$) and by locality.\n</ul>\n<p>The internal nonassociativity shows up in how these generators combine and\nin the structure of their spectra, not in the C$^*$-algebra axioms\nthemselves (which remain associative).</p>\n<h3>AQFT vs.\\ Feynman-diagram intuition</h3>\n<p>The algebraic language does not forbid Feynman diagrams; it puts them in\nperspective. In simple regimes and near-Gaussian states, one can still\nexpand correlation functions in diagrams. But:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>The existence of a Fock space and a perturbative expansion is no\n longer an axiom, but a property of certain states.\n <li>Nonperturbative aspects (phase structure, superselection sectors,\n thermal states) can be discussed directly in terms of algebras and\n states.\n <li>The nonassociative internal geometry is built into the operator\n content, not into a particular path integral measure.\n</ul>\n<p>For an exceptional, nonassociative internal space, this is conceptually\nsafer than starting from a single classical Lagrangian and hoping that\nperturbation theory can see everything.</p>\n<h3>Connection to spectral geometry and 21 December</h3>\n<p>AQFT and spectral geometry address complementary aspects:</p>\n<ul>\n <li><strong>Spectral geometry</strong> (yesterday) tells us how to build an\n action from a Dirac spectrum that includes gravity and gauge\n fields.\n <li><strong>AQFT</strong> (today) tells us how to formulate the quantum theory\n of the resulting fields in a representation-free way.\n</ul>\n<p>On December 21, the fourth Advent Sunday, these threads meet: an\noctonionic version of AQFT is combined with an $F_4$-symmetric Jordan\npotential. The electroweak scale then appears as an equilibrium quantity\nof the internal geometry, and the local algebras inherit this scale\nthrough their operator content.</p>\n<h3>Why this day matters conceptually</h3>\n<p>The AQFT day is less about new numbers and more about cleaning up the\nfoundations:</p>\n<ol>\n <li>It frees the octonionic model from the straightjacket of a single\n Fock space and a fixed perturbative expansion.\n <li>It highlights that what matters fundamentally are <em>operators</em>\n and their algebraic relations, not a particular graphical\n technique.\n <li>It prepares the ground for rigorous discussions of locality,\n causality and phases in a world with an exceptional internal\n structure.\n</ol>\n<p>One hundred years after Heisenberg's operator approach, AQFT can be read\nas a modern continuation of his original spirit—now extended to an\noctonionic internal world that he could not have imagined.</p>\n<p>\\small\n\\begin{thebibliography}{9}</p>\n<p>\\bibitem{HaagKastler1964}\nR.~Haag and D.~Kastler,\n\\newblock ``An algebraic approach to quantum field theory,''\n\\newblock {\\em J.\\ Math.\\ Phys.} <strong>5</strong>, 848--861 (1964).</p>\n<p>\\bibitem{Haag1996}\nR.~Haag,\n\\newblock {\\em Local Quantum Physics},\n\\newblock Springer, 1996.</p>\n<p>\\bibitem{Internal}\n[Internal notes on AQFT formulation and octonionic local algebras:\n{\\tt chap18\\_neu.tex; appF\\_neu.tex}.]</p>\n<p>\\end{thebibliography}\n\\normalsize</p>",

      "content": "<h3>Visible matter from compressors</h3>\n<p>y now, the compressor picture of visible matter is\nfamiliar:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>A vacuum configuration $\\langle H\\rangle$ in the Albert algebra\n $H_3(\\mathbb{O})$ defines a mass map $\\Pi(\\langle H\\rangle)$.\n <li>Its eigenvalues give prototype fermion masses,\n $m_i \\sim \\mathrm{eig}_i\\bigl(\\Pi(\\langle H\\rangle)\\bigr)$.\n <li>Misalignment between different compressors yields flavour mixing\n (CKM, PMNS).\n</ul>\n<p>The crucial point is that all of this uses the <em>same</em> operator\ntoolbox: symmetric compressors built from $\\langle H\\rangle$, living on the\nsame internal octonionic stage that also hosts rotors.</p>\n<h3>Where is the dark sector?</h3>\n<p>Astronomy and cosmology tell us that there is about five times more dark\nmatter than ordinary baryonic matter. In the octonionic setting, the most\neconomical question is not ``What exotic field should we add?'', but:</p>\n<blockquote>\n Which parts of the existing compressor structure remain invisible to\n rotors and Standard-Model charges?\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Albert algebra $H_3(\\mathbb{O})$ is large enough to contain subspaces\nthat do not talk directly to the visible sector. Geometrically, one can\ndistinguish:</p>\n<ul>\n <li><strong>bright directions:</strong> eigenvectors that carry nontrivial\n rotor charges and thus couple to known forces;\n <li><strong>shadow directions:</strong> eigenvectors that are neutral under all\n rotors associated with $SU(3)\\times SU(2)\\times U(1)$, but still\n present in the compressor spectra.\n</ul>\n<p>Eigenvalues along these shadow directions contribute mass, but not\nelectromagnetic or color charge. They are prime candidates for a dark\nsector.</p>\n<h3>Sterile compressors</h3>\n<p>Formally, a <em>sterile compressor</em> $C_{\\text{sterile}}$ is a symmetric\noperator on the internal space with the following properties:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>Its eigenvectors are eigenstates of all relevant rotors with\n <em>trivial</em> eigenvalues (no charge, no weak isospin, no color).\n <li>It appears in the same algebraic representation as the visible\n compressors $C_{\\text{vis}}$, but in a different block that does\n not mix with them at tree level.\n</ul>\n<p>We can symbolically write the mass eigenvalues as\n\\[\n m_{\\text{DM}} \\;\\sim\\; \\mathrm{eig}\\bigl(C_{\\text{sterile}}\\bigr),\\qquad\n m_{\\text{vis}} \\;\\sim\\; \\mathrm{eig}\\bigl(C_{\\text{vis}}\\bigr),\n\\]\nwith\n\\[\n [C_{\\text{sterile}},G_a] \\approx 0\n \\quad\\text{for all visible rotors }G_a,\n\\]\nwhile $[C_{\\text{vis}},G_a]$ is generically nonzero.</p>\n<p>Such a sterile compressor creates mass without visible force couplings:\nits eigenmodes are massive but dark.</p>\n<h3>Mass ranges and stability</h3>\n<p>The octonionic model itself does not yet predict an absolute dark-matter\nmass scale; that would require a detailed choice of $\\langle H\\rangle$ and\nits embedding in $H_3(\\mathbb{O})$. But structurally, it constrains <em>how</em>\ndark matter can look:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>Dark modes share the same Jordan invariants as visible ones; they\n are not arbitrary fields but live in the same exceptional algebra.\n <li>Stability is natural: if shadow eigenvectors do not couple to\n rotors, there are no fast decay channels into visible particles.\n <li>Interactions among dark modes can still exist via their own rotor\n network in the sterile block, potentially leading to self-interacting\n dark matter scenarios.\n</ul>\n<p>Cosmologically, such a sector would gravitate like ordinary matter, but be\ninvisible to electromagnetic and strong probes—precisely what astronomical\ndata suggest.</p>\n<h3>Why this is not just ``add a scalar''</h3>\n<p>Many dark-matter models add new fields or symmetries by hand. The\ncompressor picture is conceptually different:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>No new algebraic ingredient is introduced beyond the existing\n exceptional structure.\n <li>Dark matter arises as an <em>unused corner</em> of the same mass map\n that generates visible fermion spectra.\n <li>The number of dark degrees of freedom, their charges (or lack\n thereof) and their possible self-interactions are constrained by\n the representation theory of $H_3(\\mathbb{O})$ and $F_4$.\n</ul>\n<p>In that sense, the model does not explain ``why there is dark matter'' from\nfirst principles, but it offers a natural place for it to live—with much\nless arbitrariness than a generic beyond-the-Standard-Model scenario.</p>\n<h3>What could falsify this picture?</h3>\n<p>A compressor-based dark sector makes several expectations that can, in\nprinciple, be tested:</p>\n<ul>\n <li><strong>Gravitational only (to first approximation):</strong>\n direct electromagnetic signatures (e.g.\\ electric charge of dark\n matter) should be absent or extremely suppressed.\n <li><strong>Structured mass spectrum:</strong>\n the dark sector should not be a completely flat continuum, but\n exhibit a discrete spectrum or at least preferred mass scales,\n echoing the structure of visible masses.\n <li><strong>Possible self-interactions:</strong>\n the same formalism that builds rotors for the visible sector can\n build a sterile rotor network; this opens the door to dark\n self-interaction signals (e.g.\\ in halo shapes or cluster mergers).\n</ul>\n<p>If future observations conclusively ruled out any such patterns—e.g.\\ if\ndark matter were shown to be almost featureless, perfectly cold and\nnon-interacting even with itself—the compressor-shadow picture would lose\nmuch of its appeal.</p>\n<h3>A structural, not final, proposal</h3>\n<p>This Advent sheet is deliberately cautious:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>It does not claim to have <em>the</em> dark-matter candidate, with a\n precise mass and cross section ready for exclusion plots.\n <li>It does claim that, once you take the octonionic/Albert structure\n seriously, a dark sector is almost unavoidable: there are simply\n too many directions that do not couple to visible rotors.\n</ul>\n<p>Dark matter thus appears less as an alien addition and more as a\nstructural shadow of the same exceptional geometry that organises quarks\nand leptons. The same operator toolbox—rotors and compressors on\n$H_3(\\mathbb{O})$—carries both visible and dark sectors; the difference\nlies in which eigenvectors we are able to illuminate.</p>\n<p>\\small\n\\begin{thebibliography}{9}</p>\n<p>\\bibitem{Zwicky1933}\nF.~Zwicky,\n\\newblock ``Die Rotverschiebung von extragalaktischen Nebeln,''\n\\newblock {\\em Helv.\\ Phys.\\ Acta} <strong>6</strong>, 110–127 (1933).</p>\n<p>\\bibitem{Rubin1970}\nV.~Rubin and W.~K.~Ford Jr.,\n\\newblock ``Rotation of the Andromeda nebula from a spectroscopic survey of\nemission regions,''\n\\newblock {\\em Astrophys.\\ J.} <strong>159</strong>, 379 (1970).</p>\n<p>\\bibitem{Chap14}\n[Internal notes on compressor sectors and dark modes, see {\\tt chap14\\_neu.tex;\nchap20\\_neu.tex}.]</p>\n<p>\\end{thebibliography}\n\\normalsize</p>",

Both issues\n meet on this fourth Advent Sunday. An algebraic quantum field theory\n (AQFT) formulation replaces Hilbert-space dogma by local algebras on\n the octonionic stage, while an $F_4$-symmetric potential fixes the\n electroweak scale $Y_S$ as a true equilibrium quantity:\n $$Y_S^2 = -\\frac{\\mu^2}{2(\\lambda+\\kappa c)}.$$</p>",
      "content": "<h3>QFT without Hilbert-space dogma</h3>\n<p>tandard quantum field theory is usually presented as a\nstory about fields on spacetime, quantised on a Hilbert space and expanded\nin creation and annihilation operators. For highly nontrivial internal\nstructures like octonions and the Albert algebra, this picture is more a\nhindrance than a help.</p>\n<p>Algebraic quantum field theory (AQFT) offers a different starting point:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>The fundamental objects are <em>local *-algebras</em>\n $\\mathcal{A}(\\mathcal{O})$ assigned to spacetime regions\n $\\mathcal{O}$.\n <li>States are positive linear functionals\n $\\omega: \\mathcal{A}(\\mathcal{O}) \\to \\mathbb{C}$, not vectors in a\n pre-chosen Hilbert space.\n <li>Dynamics and symmetries act as automorphisms of the net\n $\\mathcal{O} \\mapsto \\mathcal{A}(\\mathcal{O})$.\n</ul>\n<p>This fits the octonionic framework naturally:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>The internal degrees of freedom live in nonassociative structures;\n their observables sit more comfortably in operator algebras than in\n a single global Hilbert basis.\n <li>Locality and covariance are built into the net of algebras, not\n into a particular field representation.\n</ul>\n<h3>Local algebras on an octonionic stage</h3>\n<p>In the present model, the internal octonionic/Albert structure augments\nordinary spacetime. A minimal AQFT-compatible picture is:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>To each spacetime region $\\mathcal{O}$ we assign a local algebra\n $\\mathcal{A}(\\mathcal{O})$ generated by\n <ul>\n <li>rotor operators (internal symmetry generators),\n <li>compressor-derived fields (mass/mixing structures),\n <li>and possibly additional scalar modes related to the\n Jordan potential.\n </ul>\n <li>The net $\\mathcal{O}\\mapsto\\mathcal{A}(\\mathcal{O})$ satisfies the\n Haag–Kastler axioms: isotony, locality (commutativity at spacelike\n separation), covariance under the relevant spacetime symmetries.\n</ul>\n<p>Quantisation in this picture means: we specify the algebra and its\nrelations, then look at representations (states) that realise this net on\nHilbert spaces <em>a posteriori</em>. This reverses the usual logic:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>Instead of quantising classical fields, we start from an operator\n algebra informed by octonionic geometry.\n <li>Hilbert spaces appear only as GNS completions of chosen states, not\n as primary input.\n</ul>\n<h3>The $F_4$-symmetric potential</h3>\n<p>Beyond the kinematics of local algebras, we need dynamics and vacuum\nstructure. The central object is a Jordan element $H \\in H_3(\\mathbb{O})$\nand a potential $V_J(H)$ that is invariant under an $F_4$ symmetry acting\non the Albert algebra.</p>\n<p>A typical $F_4$-invariant potential has the schematic form\n\\[\n V_J(H) \\;=\\; \\mu^2\\,\\mathrm{Tr}(H^2)\n + \\lambda\\,\\mathrm{Tr}(H^4)\n + \\kappa\\,c\\,(\\det H)\n + \\cdots,\n\\]\nwhere the invariants (trace, determinant, higher Jordan invariants) are\norganised such that $F_4$ acts as the symmetry group of the potential.</p>\n<p>The electroweak order parameter $Y_S$ is then read as a particular\ncomponent or invariant of the vacuum expectation value $\\langle H\\rangle$.\nMinimising $V_J$ with respect to this degree of freedom leads to a\ncondition of the form\n\\[\n \\frac{\\partial V_J}{\\partial Y_S} = 0\n \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad\n Y_S^2 = -\\frac{\\mu^2}{2(\\lambda+\\kappa c)}.\n\\]</p>\n<h3>Electroweak scale as equilibrium quantity</h3>\n<p>The formula\n\\[\n Y_S^2 = -\\frac{\\mu^2}{2(\\lambda+\\kappa c)}\n\\]\nshould be read structurally, not numerically. It expresses three key\npoints:</p>\n<ol>\n <li>The electroweak scale is not inserted by hand; it is a\n <em>minimum</em> of an $F_4$-symmetric potential.\n <li>The same invariants that control the structure of the operator\n toolbox (rotors, compressors, radius operator) also enter the\n coefficients $(\\mu^2,\\lambda,\\kappa c)$.\n <li>Small changes in these coefficients lead to controlled shifts in\n $Y_S$, not to arbitrary values: the scale is a stable equilibrium\n of the internal geometry.\n</ol>\n<p>In other words, the 246 GeV scale is reinterpreted as an equilibrium\nquantity of the exceptional internal space, analogous to how a crystal\nlattice spacing is an equilibrium of an atomic potential, not an external\nparameter.</p>\n<h3>Connecting AQFT and the potential</h3>\n<p>The AQFT and potential pictures are not separate stories:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>The potential $V_J(H)$ determines the vacuum configuration\n $\\langle H\\rangle$, hence the compressor spectra and the operator\n content of the local algebras $\\mathcal{A}(\\mathcal{O})$.\n <li>Conversely, the dynamics of fields in AQFT—encoded in the local\n algebras and their time evolution—are constrained by the same\n internal symmetries ($G_2$, $F_4$) that shaped the potential.\n</ul>\n<p>This dual view is typical of modern mathematical physics:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>On the <em>operator side</em>, we quantise via local algebras and\n states, avoiding early commitment to particular Fock spaces.\n <li>On the <em>potential side</em>, we see vacuum structure and symmetry\n breaking as consequences of exceptional invariants.\n</ul>\n<h3>What remains open and what is gained</h3>\n<p>The fourth Advent Sunday is intentionally honest about open questions:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>The gravitational sector is not yet fully encoded; the ratio\n $\\kappa = m_p/m_P$ still enters as an external constant, to be\n addressed by a future spectral-gravity analysis.\n <li>Renormalisation and nonperturbative effects in an octonionic AQFT\n remain technically challenging.\n</ul>\n<p>But we gain two important things:</p>\n<ol>\n <li>A quantisation framework—AQFT—that is robust enough to house\n nonassociative internal structures.\n <li>A structural explanation of the electroweak scale as an equilibrium\n value of an $F_4$-symmetric potential, linked tightly to the rest\n of the operator toolbox.\n</ol>\n<p>\\small\n\\begin{thebibliography}{9}</p>\n<p>\\bibitem{Haag1996}\nR.~Haag,\n\\newblock {\\em Local Quantum Physics},\n\\newblock Springer, 1996.</p>\n<p>\\bibitem{HaagKastler1964}\nR.~Haag and D.~Kastler,\n\\newblock ``An algebraic approach to quantum field theory,''\n\\newblock {\\em J.\\ Math.\\ Phys.} <strong>5</strong>, 848--861 (1964).</p>\n<p>\\bibitem{Freund1985}\nP.~G.~O.~Freund,\n\\newblock {\\em Introduction to Supersymmetry},\n\\newblock Cambridge University Press, 1985.</p>\n<p>\\bibitem{ConnesChamseddine}\nA.~Connes and A.~H.~Chamseddine,\n\\newblock ``The spectral action principle,''\n\\newblock {\\em Commun.\\ Math.\\ Phys.} <strong>186</strong>, 731--750 (1997).</p>\n<p>\\end{thebibliography}\n\\normalsize</p>",

      "subtitle": "<p>From ``input parameters'' to attractors and minima</p>",
      "keyInsight": "<p>In the textbook Standard Model, parameters like the fine-structure\n constant $\\alpha$, the strong coupling $\\alpha_s$, the Weinberg angle\n $\\theta_W$, fermion masses and mixing angles appear as independent\n inputs. In the octonionic/Albert framework, many of them can be read as\n <em>equilibrium values</em>: minima of an $F_4$-symmetric potential,\n attractor radii of an internal flow, or angles between preferred rotor\n directions. Physical constants become what the internal exceptional\n geometry <em>settles into</em>, not arbitrary dials.</p>",
      "content": "<h3>Constants vs.\\ equilibrium values</h3>\n<p>n everyday language, a ``constant of nature'' is a\nnumber that does not change over time. But for theory building there is a\ndeeper question:</p>\n<blockquote>\n Is the constant a fundamental input, or is it the value that some\n dynamical or geometric system relaxes to?\n</blockquote>\n<p>In statistical mechanics, equilibrium temperatures and densities are not\nfundamental; they are fixed points of microscopic dynamics. The octonionic\nmodel applies this logic to parts of high-energy physics:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>Couplings and angles become norms and overlaps in rotor space.\n <li>Mass scales become attractor radii of an internal flow.\n <li>Order parameters become minima of an $F_4$-invariant potential.\n</ul>\n<h3>Electroweak scale as a potential minimum</h3>\n<p>A central example from the 4th Advent (21 December) is the electroweak\nscale $Y_S$. A Jordan potential\n\\[\n V_J(H) = \\mu^2 \\,\\mathrm{Tr}(H^2)\n + \\lambda\\,\\mathrm{Tr}(H^4)\n + \\kappa\\,c\\,\\det H\n + \\cdots\n\\]\non $H_3(\\mathbb{O})$, invariant under $F_4$, has a minimum at some vacuum\n$\\langle H\\rangle$. Reading $Y_S$ as a suitable component or invariant of\n$\\langle H\\rangle$ and minimising $V_J$ yields a relation of the type\n\\[\n Y_S^2 = -\\frac{\\mu^2}{2(\\lambda + \\kappa c)}.\n\\]</p>\n<p>Here $Y_S$ is not an arbitrary input; it is the equilibrium value of the\norder parameter in an exceptional potential. The observed electroweak\nscale is then analogous to a lattice spacing in a crystal: an equilibrium\ndistance, not a fundamental length.</p>\n<h3>Angles and couplings as geometric overlaps</h3>\n<p>From 10 December we remember: couplings and the Weinberg angle can be read\nfrom rotor geometry. With an inner product\n\\[\n \\langle A,B\\rangle = \\mathrm{Tr}(A^\\dagger B),\n\\]\nand rotor directions $G_W$ (weak isospin) and $G_Y$ (hypercharge), one\ndefines\n\\[\n \\cos\\theta_W =\n \\frac{\\langle G_W,G_Y\\rangle}\n {\\|G_W\\|\\,\\|G_Y\\|}.\n\\]</p>\n<p>Similarly, $\\alpha$ and $\\alpha_s$ track the norms of appropriate\ncommutators in the internal operator space. Once the embedding of\n$SU(3)_C\\times SU(2)_L\\times U(1)_Y$ into the exceptional algebra is\nfixed, the <em>relative</em> normalisation of these norms is fixed as well.\nRunning with energy complicates the picture, but the low-energy values are\nno longer independent dials; they are correlated by the underlying\ngeometry.</p>\n<p>In this sense, $\\theta_W$ and the ratios between $\\alpha$ and $\\alpha_s$\nare <em>geometric equilibrium values</em>: the angles and norms selected by a\nparticular embedding of the Standard Model group into the exceptional\nsymmetry.</p>\n<h3>Mass hierarchies as attractor radii</h3>\n<p>The radius operator and attractor mechanism from earlier days provide\nanother route to equilibrium values. Internal flows in the space of\nconfigurations—driven by renormalisation-group or effective potential\ngradients—develop attractors at characteristic radii\n\\[\n R \\sim R_{\\ast,1},\\; R_{\\ast,2},\\;\\ldots\n\\]\ncorresponding to:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>low-energy QCD scale,\n <li>electroweak scale,\n <li>higher intermediate scales.\n</ul>\n<p>Fermion masses then fall into bands or shells around these radii, with the\nprecise eigenvalues determined by the compressor spectra. The huge\nhierarchies between these radii (e.g.\\ Planck vs.\\ electroweak) can be\ntraced back to nonassociativity (8 December): strong deviations from\nassociativity produce exponential separations between attractor radii.</p>\n<p>Thus, mass ratios are not ``inserted by hand''; they are equilibrium\noutcomes of flows on an exceptional internal manifold.</p>\n<h3>What remains external</h3>\n<p>The equilibrium perspective is powerful but not unlimited. In the current\nstate of the model:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>The gravitational coupling—equivalently the Planck mass $m_P$—is\n still external (16 December).\n <li>The ratio $\\kappa = m_p/m_P$ is acknowledged as an input, awaiting\n a spectral-geometry derivation.\n <li>The cosmological constant is not yet computed from an octonionic\n spectral action.\n</ul>\n<p>So the slogan ``constants are equilibrium values'' is true for many, but\nnot yet for all of them. The calendar is explicit about this boundary.</p>\n<h3>Conceptual shift: from parameter lists to geometry</h3>\n<p>The main conceptual gain of this day is not a new formula but a new\nclassification:</p>\n<ol>\n <li><strong>Equilibrium constants:</strong>\n values fixed by minima of potentials, attractors of flows, or fixed\n geometric overlaps (e.g.\\ $Y_S$, many fermion masses, $\\theta_W$,\n relative couplings).\n <li><strong>Spectral constants (future work):</strong>\n values to be derived from the spectrum of a combined Dirac operator in\n spectral geometry (e.g.\\ $G$, cosmological constant).\n <li><strong>Still-external constants:</strong>\n numbers not yet tied to the exceptional structure in the present\n model.\n</ol>\n<p>This is a clear upgrade over a flat parameter list: we know which constants\nare already inside the exceptional story, which should be pulled in via\nspectral geometry, and which ones remain open.</p>\n<h3>Why this matters for physics, not just for aesthetics</h3>\n<p>From a pragmatic viewpoint, one might say: as long as the model matches\ndata, who cares whether a parameter is an input or an equilibrium value?\nThe answer is twofold:</p>\n<ul>\n <li><strong>Predictivity:</strong> Equilibrium values are constrained: small\n changes in the microscopic setup lead to calculable shifts, not\n arbitrary variations. This opens the door to quantitative tests.\n <li><strong>Stability:</strong> Equilibrium interpretation explains why\n certain values are robust under perturbations, decoupling of heavy\n fields, or environmental changes.\n</ul>\n<p>If, step by step, more of the Standard Model parameter list can be turned\ninto equilibrium values of an exceptional geometry, the notorious\n``fine-tuning'' problems change character: we no longer tune against\nnothing; we characterise which equilibria of which internal structures are\nrealised in our Universe.</p>\n<p>\\small\n\\begin{thebibliography}{9}</p>\n<p>\\bibitem{ConnesChamseddine}\nA.~Connes and A.~H.~Chamseddine,\n\\newblock ``The spectral action principle,''\n\\newblock {\\em Commun.\\ Math.\\ Phys.} <strong>186</strong>, 731--750 (1997).</p>\n<p>\\bibitem{GurseyTze1996}\nF.~G\\\"ursey and H.~C.~Tze,\n\\newblock {\\em On the Role of Division, Jordan and Related Algebras in\nParticle Physics},\n\\newblock World Scientific, 1996.</p>\n<p>\\bibitem{Internal}\n[Internal notes on attractors, rotor norms and constants as equilibria:\n{\\tt arxiv-const.tex; appK\\_neu.tex; appE\\_neu.tex}.]</p>\n<p>\\end{thebibliography}\n\\normalsize</p>",

      "content": "<h3>What survives untouched</h3>\n<p>espite octonions, Jordan algebras and spectral tricks,\nseveral pillars of QFT remain in place:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>Locality and causality are still enforced via commutation\n relations or, in AQFT language, via locality of the net\n $\\mathcal{O}\\mapsto\\mathcal{A}(\\mathcal{O})$.\n <li>States are still positive linear functionals on an operator\n algebra; probabilities are still given by expectation values and\n Born's rule.\n <li>Renormalisation, running couplings and effective-field-theory\n reasoning retain their conceptual role.\n</ul>\n<p>In that sense, the octonionic programme is not a revolution <em>against</em>\nQFT; it is a reorganisation <em>within</em> its operator framework.</p>\n<h3>What changes in the kinematical stage</h3>\n<p>The radical part lies in the choice of underlying structures:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>The internal Hilbert space is no longer an arbitrary finite tensor\n product; it is tied to the representation theory of\n $\\mathbb{O}$ and $H_3(\\mathbb{O})$.\n <li>Gauge groups are not postulated separately; they emerge from\n automorphisms of these exceptional structures.\n <li>Mass and mixing operators (compressors, mass map) are not generic\n matrices but constrained by the geometry of the Albert algebra.\n</ul>\n<p>Instead of a long list of independent fields and representations, we start\nfrom a <em>single</em> exceptional stage and let its operator content\nunfold.

This flips the usual order:</p>\n<blockquote>\n Operator geometry first, Feynman rules later.\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Fields vs.\\ modes of an exceptional vacuum</h3>\n<p>Another shift concerns what we call ``fundamental fields''. In the\nStandard Model language:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>gauge fields $A_\\mu$,\n <li>fermion fields $\\psi$,\n <li>the Higgs scalar $H$,\n</ul>\nappear side by side as basic degrees of freedom.\n<p>In the exceptional picture:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>Fermion multiplets arise as specific representations of\n $H_3(\\mathbb{O})$ and its rotor algebra.\n <li>Masses come from the spectrum of the mass map $\\Pi(\\langle H\\rangle)$.\n <li>The Higgs becomes a fluctuation mode of the vacuum element\n $\\langle H\\rangle$, not the origin of mass (11 December).\n</ul>\n<p>Gauge fields still appear as connections, but their group structure and\ncouplings are read from rotor geometry. The distinction between ``matter''\nand ``mediator'' fields becomes partly a matter of which operators we\nchoose to treat as background (vacuum) and which as excitations.</p>\n<h3>Parameters vs.\\ equilibrium data</h3>\n<p>From 22 December we learned to reclassify constants:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>Many couplings and mass scales become equilibrium values:\n minima of an $F_4$-symmetric potential or attractor radii.\n <li>Angles like $\\theta_W$ become literal angles between rotor\n directions.\n <li>Only a small core of numbers (notably those tied to gravity)\n remain external in the current state of the model.\n</ul>\n<p>In QFT language this means: the space of possible Lagrangians is no longer\na huge free parameter space; it is the image of a much smaller space of\nexceptional-geometric choices (vacuum embeddings, embeddings of the gauge\ngroup, spectral scales).</p>\n<h3>AQFT and spectral geometry as consistency checks</h3>\n<p>Finally, AQFT and spectral geometry serve as consistency filters:</p>\n<ul>\n <li><strong>AQFT</strong> asks whether the operator content can be organised\n into a local, covariant net of algebras with reasonable state\n structure (18 and 21 December).\n <li><strong>Spectral geometry</strong> asks whether there exists a Dirac\n operator whose spectral action reproduces both the internal\n dynamics and gravity in a controlled expansion (17 December).\n</ul>\n<p>Many aesthetically pleasing algebraic constructions fail one or both of\nthese tests.

Concretely, all sectors — Dirac, Yang–Mills, Einstein and inflation — can be read as projections of a single octonionic master action \n$S[D,\\Psi]$, built from one operator $D$ and the unified fermion state $\\Psi$.</p>",
      "content": "<h3>Back to the beginning</h3>\n<p>n the first Advent Sunday we started with a seemingly\ninnocent observation: there exist only four normed division algebras over\nthe reals, and the last one, the octonions $\\mathbb{O}$, is both\nnoncommutative and nonassociative. Its automorphism group $G_2$ and the\ntriality of $\\mathrm{Spin}(8)$ suggested that internal degrees of freedom\nin particle physics might have a natural home in this $8$-dimensional\nnumber system.</p>\n<p>Over the following days, we introduced:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>The Albert algebra $H_3(\\mathbb{O})$ as a $27$-dimensional\n exceptional Jordan algebra whose automorphism group is $F_4$.\n <li>An $\\mathfrak{so}(8)$-valued connection $A_\\mu$ on $\\mathbb{R}^8$\n and the master equation $D\\Psi=0$ as a unified transport law.\n <li>The mass map $\\Pi(H)$, compressor and rotor operators and their\n eigenvalues as the organizing principles for fermion masses and\n couplings.\n</ul>\n<p>Along the way, we reinterpreted well-known objects --- three generations,\nCKM/PMNS, $\\alpha\\approx1/137$ --- through the lens of exceptional\ngeometry.</p>\n<h3>One rigid object, many apparent structures</h3>\n<p>At each step we have tried to avoid the typical proliferation of\nindependent assumptions. Instead of:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>one space(time) manifold,\n <li>one gauge group,\n <li>one matter content,\n <li>one set of Yukawa matrices,\n <li>one gravitational sector,\n</ul>\n<p>we considered a single package:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>an external stage $\\mathbb{R}^8$,\n <li>an internal algebra $H_3(\\mathbb{O})$ with $F_4$ symmetry,\n <li>an $\\mathfrak{so}(8)$-valued connection $A_\\mu$,\n <li>a vacuum configuration $\\langle H\\rangle$ and its associated\n mass map $\\Pi(\\langle H\\rangle)$.\n</ul>\n<p>From this one package, multiple familiar pieces emerge:</p>\n<ul>\n <li><strong>Dirac, Yang--Mills, Einstein</strong> appear as projections and\n integrability conditions of the master equation $D\\Psi = 0$.\n <li><strong>Three generations</strong> are read as three triality-related\n faces of one internal Spin(8) block embedded in $H_3(\\mathbb{O})$.\n <li><strong>Mixing matrices</strong> become transition maps between preferred\n eigenbases of operators on the Albert algebra.\n <li><strong>Couplings</strong> such as $\\alpha$, $\\alpha_s$, and\n $\\sin^2\\theta_W$ arise as squared norms of commutators of internal\n rotors.\n</ul>\n<p>The ``wow'' here is not any single formula, but the fact that so many\napparently unrelated structures coalesce into one geometric object.</p>\n<h3>One operator, one action</h3>\n<p>So far we have stressed that a single operator $D$ on $\\mathbb{R}^8$,\ntogether with its curvature and defect operators, carries all the\nstructures we usually describe by many separate fields.\nThe natural next step is to assemble these ingredients into one\nunified dynamical principle: a candidate <em>master action</em> $S[D,\\Psi]$.</p>\n<p>In schematic form,\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\n S[D,\\Psi]\n \\;=\\;\n \\int_{M_4}\\!\\sqrt{-g}\\;\n \\Bigl(\n \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{kin}}[D]\n + \\mathcal{L}_{F}[D]\n + \\mathcal{L}_{G}[D] \\\\\n + \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{Defekt}}[D]\n + \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{matter}}[D,\\Psi]\n \\Bigr),\n\\end{eqnarray*}\nwhere:\n<ul>\n <li>$D$ contains the spin connection (gravity), all internal gauge\n fields ($SU(3)\\times SU(2)\\times U(1)$) and the compressor blocks\n that generate Yukawa couplings,\n <li>$F=[D,D]$ encodes Yang--Mills field strengths and spacetime\n curvature,\n <li>$G=[D,\\tau D]$ is an interference operator whose potential\n realises inflation in the early universe,\n <li>$\\mathcal{A}(D)$ is the octonionic associator lift whose\n defect tensor reproduces the Einstein tensor in the long-wavelength\n limit,\n <li>$\\Psi\\in H_3(\\mathbb{O})$ collects all three generations of\n fermions.\n</ul></p>\n<p>The slogan is:\n\\[\n \\text{one operator $D$, one action $S[D,\\Psi]$}\n \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad\n \\text{Dirac, Yang--Mills, Einstein, inflation.}\n\\]\nVariation with respect to $D$ produces, in different projections,\nDirac, Yang--Mills, Einstein and inflaton equations; variation with\nrespect to $\\Psi$ yields the Dirac equations for all fermions.</p>\n<p>In this sense the unification achieved here is not only a unification\nof groups or representations, but a unification of kinematics,\ninteractions and geometry into a single octonionic dynamical object.</p>\n<p>\\paragraph{Status.}\nStructurally, $S[D,\\Psi]$ provides a unified stage on which all known\nsectors (Dirac, Yang--Mills, gravity, inflation, flavour) can be written\ntogether. Dynamically and phenomenologically, it is still a programme:\nthe full derivation of Einstein's equations, the precise values of all\ncouplings, and the detailed renormalisation behaviour of this action are\nwork in progress rather than accomplished facts.</p>\n<h3>Lessons from the false universes</h3>\n<p>In the later days we briefly stepped outside this framework and asked:\nwhat happens if we deliberately choose the ``wrong'' algebras? What if we\ntry to build a world on:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>only complex numbers $\\mathbb{C}$ and their unitary groups,\n <li>or only quaternions $\\mathbb{H}$ without nonassociativity,\n <li>or a generic matrix algebra with no exceptional features?\n</ul>\n<p>We discovered that whole families of desired properties are then lost or\nbecome unnatural:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>Three generations no longer have a canonical origin; one simply\n copies the matter content by hand.\n <li>The intricate pattern of charges and hypercharges becomes a\n balancing act of assignments, not a consequence of a constrained\n internal geometry.\n <li>Gauge couplings become freely adjustable parameters with no reason\n to be related.\n</ul>\n<p>The purpose of this detour was not to prove that only the octonionic story\nis viable, but to show that <em>once</em> one asks for a web of correlated\nfeatures, the room for algebraic models becomes dramatically smaller.</p>\n<h3>Numerical prototypes as reality checks</h3>\n<p>We have also seen that the model is not condemned to remain purely\nsymbolic. Simple vacuum configurations $\\langle H\\rangle$ in $H_3(\\mathbb{O})$\nalready produce:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>banded, hierarchical mass spectra via $\\Pi(\\langle H\\rangle)$,\n <li>sector-dependent splitting patterns for quark-like and\n lepton-like modes,\n <li>robust structures that persist under moderate deformations of\n the vacuum.\n</ul>\n<p>These ``numerical prototypes'' are not the final word, but they provide\na reality check: the exceptional machinery can generate concrete spectra\nwith the right kind of complexity, without inserting hierarchies by hand.\nThey turn the model from a purely aesthetic proposal into something that\ncan be explored, tuned and falsified.</p>\n<h3>What has really been unified?</h3>\n<p>It is tempting to summarise the story as ``a new unification of the\nStandard Model and gravity''. This is true, but slightly misleading.\nWhat is really being unified is:</p>\n<ul>\n <li><strong>kinematics and interactions:</strong> the derivative $D=\\partial+A$\n refuses to separate ``free'' motion from connections;\n <li><strong>fields and operators:</strong> matter and gauge bosons are read\n as faces of the operator $D$ and its curvature, in the spirit of\n spectral geometry;\n <li><strong>algebra and phenomenology:</strong> detailed numerical patterns\n (masses, mixings, couplings) are tied back to discrete choices\n of internal algebraic data.\n</ul>\n<p>In this sense, the model does not merely unify gauge groups; it unifies\n<em>levels of description</em> that are usually kept separate in physics.</p>\n<h3>Where the open questions are</h3>\n<p>A Meta-Wow page must also be honest about what remains unresolved. Among\nthe open questions are:</p>\n<ul>\n <li><strong>Dynamics of the vacuum:</strong> Why does the universe select a\n particular $\\langle H\\rangle$ inside the huge space of possible\n configurations? Are there attractor mechanisms or selection\n principles beyond aesthetic appeal?\n<li><strong>Precise spectra:</strong> Can one tune the model to reproduce\n the known fermion masses and mixings within experimental\n uncertainties, and what does this tuning tell us about the\n internal geometry?\n<li><strong>Quantum consistency:</strong> How does the nonassociative\n structure of $\\mathbb{O}$ and $H_3(\\mathbb{O})$ manifest itself\n in a fully quantum framework? Which parts survive renormalisation,\n and which are effective descriptions?\n<li><strong>Cosmological implications:</strong> Does the exceptional geometry\n leave imprints on early-universe cosmology, dark matter or dark\n energy that could be observable?\n</ul>\n<p>These are not minor technicalities; they are the heart of the research\nprogram that the Advent calendar has only sketched.</p>\n<h3>Why this might still be the right story</h3>\n<p>Despite the open questions, there are compelling reasons to take this\noctonionic/exceptional picture seriously:</p>\n<ol>\n <li><strong>Economy of assumptions:</strong> Many independent ingredients of\n the Standard Model are rephrased as aspects of one algebraic object.\n <li><strong>Rigidity:</strong> Exceptional structures like $H_3(\\mathbb{O})$\n and $F_4$ leave very little room for arbitrary deformations.\n This rigidity is a feature if we seek explanations, not just fits.\n <li><strong>Qualitative matches:</strong> Three generations, hierarchical\n spectra, structured mixings and meaningful coupling patterns\n emerge in the right ballpark, not in an unrelated toy world.\n <li><strong>Mathematical depth:</strong> The model connects advanced algebra,\n geometry and operator theory in a way that resonates with other\n approaches (noncommutative geometry, spectral triples, division\n algebras) rather than contradicting them.\n</ol>\n<p>Whether or not this is how nature really works, it shows that the space\nof mathematically coherent and phenomenologically reasonable models is\nricher than the traditional menu of gauge groups and symmetry breakings.</p>\n<p>\\small\n\\begin{thebibliography}{9}</p>\n<p>\\bibitem{Baez2002}\nJ.~C.~Baez,\n\\newblock ``The octonions,''\n\\newblock {\\em Bull.\\ Amer.\\ Math.\\ Soc.} <strong>39</strong>, 145--205 (2002).</p>\n<p>\\bibitem{GurseyTze1996}\nF.~Gürsey and H.~C.~Tze,\n\\newblock {\\em On the Role of Division, Jordan and Related Algebras in Particle\nPhysics},\n\\newblock World Scientific, 1996.</p>\n<p>\\bibitem{Connes1994}\nA.~Connes,\n\\newblock {\\em Noncommutative Geometry},\n\\newblock Academic Press, 1994.</p>\n<p>\\bibitem{ConnesMarcolli2008}\nA.~Connes and M.~Marcolli,\n\\newblock {\\em Noncommutative Geometry, Quantum Fields and Motives},\n\\newblock American Mathematical Society, 2008.</p>\n<p>\\end{thebibliography}\n\\normalsize</p>",

The surprising claim is that this rigid internal stage is\n already ``almost'' the Standard Model plus gravity.</p>",
      "content": "<h3>From noncommutativity to nonassociativity</h3>\n<p>n 1925, Heisenberg's matrix mechanics marked a clean\nbreak with classical intuitions: position and momentum were no longer\nnumbers but noncommuting operators. This was a first ``algebraic turn'' in\nphysics. Today, noncommutativity is standard language in quantum theory.</p>\n<p>The next turn is less familiar. There exists a unique real division algebra\nof dimension eight, the octonions $\\mathbb{O}$, which is not only\nnoncommutative but also <em>nonassociative</em>. Multiplying three octonions\ndepends on how we place the brackets. At first sight this seems like a\nmathematical curiosity, far removed from physics.</p>\n<p>However, nonassociativity comes with a remarkable compensation: the\noctonions still admit a multiplicative norm,\n\\[\n N(xy) \\;=\\; N(x)\\,N(y),\n\\]\nand their automorphism group is the smallest exceptional Lie group $G_2$.\nThis rigid internal symmetry makes $\\mathbb{O}$ a natural candidate for a\nhidden layer beneath the familiar complex Hilbert spaces of quantum\ntheory.</p>\n<h3>The octonionic stage</h3>\n<p>The real vector space underlying the octonions is $\\mathbb{R}^8$. As a\nstage for physics it brings several features at once:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>An 8-dimensional structure that can host vectors and spinors of\n $\\mathrm{Spin}(8)$, the double cover of $\\mathrm{SO}(8)$.\n <li>A distinguished subgroup $G_2 \\subset \\mathrm{SO}(8)$ that fixes the\n multiplication table of $\\mathbb{O}$.\n <li>A triality symmetry of $\\mathrm{Spin}(8)$ that permutes its three\n eight-dimensional irreducible representations:\n vector, left-handed spinor, right-handed spinor.\n</ul>\n<p>Physically, this means that:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>Internal degrees of freedom can be arranged in three correlated\n eight-component blocks.\n <li>Rotations in the internal space can mix these blocks in a highly\n constrained way.\n</ul>\n<p>Later in the Advent calendar, these three blocks will be read as three\ngenerations of fermions, and specific subgroups will be identified with\n$SU(3)\\times SU(2)\\times U(1)$.</p>\n<h3>$G_2$ as guardian of the multiplication table</h3>\n<p>The group $G_2$ can be defined as the set of all linear maps\n$g:\\mathbb{O}\\to\\mathbb{O}$ that preserve octonionic multiplication:\n\\[\n g(xy) \\;=\\; g(x)\\,g(y)\n \\quad \\text{for all } x,y\\in\\mathbb{O}.\n\\]\nThis makes $G_2$ the symmetry group of the multiplication table. In a\nphysical setting, $G_2$-compatible transformations are those that respect\nthe hidden octonionic structure of the internal space.</p>\n<p>The existence of $G_2$ has two important consequences:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>It restricts which internal rotations are ``legal'' if we want to\n keep the multiplication law intact.\n <li>It provides a natural environment for embeddings of familiar gauge\n groups. Subgroups of $G_2$ and related structures can house\n $SU(3)$-like and $SU(2)\\times U(1)$-like symmetries.\n</ul>\n<p>In this sense, the octonionic stage with $G_2$ symmetry is already a\ncandidate for the internal symmetry space of the Standard Model.</p>\n<h3>Triality and the seed of generations</h3>\n<p>The group $\\mathrm{Spin}(8)$ acts on three eight-dimensional\nrepresentations:\n\\[\n V_8,\\quad S_8^+,\\quad S_8^-.\n\\]\nThese correspond to vectors, left-handed spinors and right-handed spinors.\nAn exceptional outer automorphism permutes these three representations. This\nis the triality symmetry.</p>\n<p>For our purposes, triality can be read as a structural reason for the\nrecurrence of the number three in particle physics:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>There is <em>one</em> internal eight-dimensional block, but it admits\n three coherent readings: $V_8$, $S_8^+$, $S_8^-$.\n <li>Later we will see how these three readings unfold into three\n generations of quarks and leptons when embedded into a larger\n exceptional algebra.\n</ul>\n<p>In this way, the abstract triality of $\\mathrm{Spin}(8)$ becomes a seed for\nfamily replication.</p>\n<h3>Why start the Advent story here?</h3>\n<p>Starting the Advent calendar with octonions, $G_2$ and triality is not an\nexercise in exotic mathematics for its own sake. It sets up three themes\nthat will run through the entire series:</p>\n<ol>\n <li><strong>Rigidity:</strong> Exceptional structures like $\\mathbb{O}$ and\n $G_2$ leave little room for arbitrary choices. This rigidity is a\n feature if we seek explanations rather than fits.\n<li><strong>Hidden simplicity:</strong> Behind the zoo of fields and parameters\n in the Standard Model there might be a much smaller set of algebraic\n building blocks.\n<li><strong>Algebra as geometry:</strong> Nonassociative multiplication and\n its automorphisms can be interpreted as a kind of curved internal\n geometry, on par with spacetime curvature in general relativity.\n</ol>\n<p>\\small\n\\begin{thebibliography}{9}</p>\n<p>\\bibitem{Heisenberg1925}\nW.~Heisenberg,\n\\newblock ``Über quantentheoretische Umdeutung kinematischer und\nmechanischer Beziehungen,''\n\\newblock {\\em Z.\\ Phys.} <strong>33</strong>, 879--893 (1925).</p>\n<p>\\bibitem{Baez2002}\nJ.~C.~Baez,\n\\newblock ``The octonions,''\n\\newblock {\\em Bull.\\ Amer.\\ Math.\\ Soc.} <strong>39</strong>, 145--205 (2002).</p>\n<p>\\bibitem{GurseyTze1996}\nF.~Gürsey and H.~C.~Tze,\n\\newblock {\\em On the Role of Division, Jordan and Related Algebras in Particle\nPhysics},\n\\newblock World Scientific, 1996.</p>\n<p>\\end{thebibliography}\n\\normalsize</p>",

      "content": "<h3>From a zoo of inputs to a structured atlas</h3>\n<p>he Standard Model appears to need dozens of free\nparameters: gauge couplings, Yukawas, mixing angles, mass ratios, vacuum\nexpectation values, hierarchy scales. Over the course of this Advent\ncalendar, many of them have been reinterpreted as:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>invariants of the $F_4$ symmetry atlas on $H_3(\\mathbb{O})$,\n <li>eigenvalues of internal operators ($H_7$, $R$, compressors),\n <li>equilibrium values of internal potentials (e.g.\\ $Y_S$),\n <li>spectral data of a Dirac operator on a structured vacuum.\n</ul>\n<p>What looked like a parameter zoo is largely a shadow of one coherent\ngeometric structure.</p>\n<h3>The algebraic backbone</h3>\n<p>The backbone of the model consists of:</p>\n<ul>\n <li><strong>Number system:</strong> octonions $\\mathbb{O}$ and their\n automorphism group $G_2$.\n <li><strong>Symmetry atlas:</strong> the Albert algebra $H_3(\\mathbb{O})$ and\n its automorphism group $F_4$.\n <li><strong>Operators:</strong> heptagon operator $H_7$, radius operator $R$,\n rotors and compressors.\n <li><strong>Vacuum:</strong> a distinguished configuration $\\langle H\\rangle$\n and associated scales $(a_0,b_0,c_0)$, $Y_S$.\n</ul>\n<p>From this small list, one can systematically derive:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>the existence of three generations (triality),\n <li>the pattern of gauge couplings (via rotor norms),\n <li>the presence of three main scales (via $\\mathrm{spec}(R)$),\n <li>the structure of mass matrices and mixings (via compressors and\n $\\Pi(\\langle H\\rangle)$),\n <li>candidates for dark sectors and vacuum energy contributions.\n</ul>\n<h3>From many parameters to one action</h3>\n<p>In a conventional presentation, the Standard Model Lagrangian carries a\nlong list of independent couplings, masses and mixing parameters. In the\noctonionic formulation used in this project, the dynamics is organised\nby a single master action\n\\[\n S[D,\\Psi]\n = \\int_{M_4} \\sqrt{-g}\\,\\Big(\n \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{kin}}[D]\n + \\mathcal{L}_F[D]\n + \\mathcal{L}_G[D]\n + \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{Defekt}}[D]\n + \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{matter}}[D,\\Psi]\n \\Big),\n\\]\nwhere $D$ encodes spin connection, gauge fields and compressor/Yukawa\nblocks, and $\\Psi$ collects three generations of fermions.</p>\n<p>Most of the ``parameters'' then become:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>discrete choices of vacuum data $(\\langle H\\rangle; a_0,b_0,c_0; Y_S)$,\n <li>algebraic invariants of the $F_4$ symmetry atlas,\n <li>and a small set of dimensionless coefficients in front of the\n operator blocks in $S[D,\\Psi]$.\n</ul>\n<p>The parameter zoo is not abolished, but it is <em>relocated</em>: from\nmany unrelated input numbers to a handful of structural choices in the\nexceptional master action.</p>\n<h3>Open block: gravity</h3>\n<p>Not everything is solved. A central open question remains:</p>\n<p>\\[\n \\kappa = \\frac{m_p}{m_P},\n\\]</p>\n<p>the ratio of proton mass to Planck mass. Together with the cosmological\nscale $\\Lambda$, it marks the gravitational block that has not yet been\nfully integrated into the octonionic sector.</p>\n<p>The spectral-action approach suggests a path:</p>\n<p>\\[\n S_{\\text{spec}} = \\mathrm{Tr}\\, f(D^2/\\Lambda^2),\n\\]</p>\n<p>where $D$ encodes both space-time and internal octonionic geometry. In a\nfuture project, this may allow $\\kappa$ and $\\Lambda$ to be understood as\nspectral invariants, closing the remaining gap —in other words, to derive the remaining gravitational coefficients in\n$S[D,\\Psi]$ from the same spectral data that govern the internal sector.</p>\n<h3>A century after Heisenberg</h3>\n<p>In 1925, Heisenberg introduced matrix mechanics, marking the beginning of\nquantum theory as an algebraic theory of observables. One hundred years\nlater, the present model can be read as a continuation of that line of\nthought:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>from matrices to nonassociative algebras,\n <li>from $SU(2)$ to $G_2$ and $F_4$,\n <li>from a list of parameters to a structured atlas of invariants.\n</ul>\n<p>The core lesson is not that octonions are ``exotic'', but that algebraic\nstructure remains a powerful guide for understanding physical reality.</p>\n<h3>From fitting to understanding</h3>\n<p>The transition can be summarised in one sentence:</p>\n<blockquote>\n We move from <em>fitting</em> independent constants to <em>understanding</em>\n them as coordinates on orbits in an exceptional symmetry atlas.\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is not the final word—open questions remain, especially on gravity\nand cosmology—but it marks a coherent step towards a less fragmented\npicture of fundamental physics.</p>\n<p>The reduction of the parameter zoo is thus conceptual and structural\nrather than yet numerically complete: many patterns are explained, but\nprecise values and quantum corrections remain an open and testable part\nof the programme.</p>\n<p>\\small\n\\begin{thebibliography}{9}</p>\n<p>\\bibitem{Heisenberg1925}\nW.~Heisenberg,\n\\newblock ``\\\"Uber quantentheoretische Umdeutung kinematischer und\nmechanischer Beziehungen,''\n\\newblock {\\em Z.\\ Phys.} <strong>33</strong>, 879--893 (1925).</p>\n<p>\\bibitem{Dirac1937}\nP.~A.~M.~Dirac,\n\\newblock ``The cosmological constants,''\n\\newblock {\\em Nature} <strong>139</strong>, 323 (1937).</p>\n<p>\\end{thebibliography}\n\\normalsize</p>",
