  "intro": "<p>Most physicists meet quantum field theory (QFT) through path integrals and Feynman diagrams on a fixed Hilbert space. For an octonionic model with a rich internal operator toolbox, this language is too rigid. Algebraic QFT (AQFT) replaces fields by nets of local algebras 𝒪↦𝒜(𝒪) and treats states as positive linear functionals, not as privileged vectors. This is the natural QFT framework for a nonassociative internal geometry.</p>\n\n<p>In the textbook picture, a quantum field theory is given by a Lagrangian, a path integral and a set of Feynman rules. Hilbert space, canonical commutation relations and perturbative expansions are baked in from the start.</p>\n\n<p>Algebraic QFT (Haag-Kastler) takes a different route. The basic object is a net of C*- or von Neumann algebras</p>\n\n<p>𝒪 ↦ 𝒜(𝒪),</p>\n\n<p>where 𝒪 runs over open regions of spacetime. This net obeys:\n• Isotony: 𝒪₁⊂𝒪₂ ⇒ 𝒜(𝒪₁)⊂𝒜(𝒪₂).\n• Locality: spacelike separated regions commute, [𝒜(𝒪₁),𝒜(𝒪₂)]=0.\n• Covariance: a symmetry group G acts by automorphisms α_g with α_g(𝒜(𝒪))=𝒜(g𝒪).</p>\n\n<p>States are positive linear functionals ω:𝒜→ℂ, not a priori elements of a given Fock space. A Hilbert-space representation arises afterwards via the GNS construction.</p>\n\n<p>The octonionic model organises internal physics in terms of operators: rotors (internal symmetry generators), compressors (mass/mixing operators), the radius operator and attractor structures, and Jordan elements H ∈ H₃(𝕆) and their potentials.</p>\n\n<p>These are naturally interpreted as elements of local algebras rather than as components of a single canonical field on a fixed Hilbert space. AQFT offers exactly the right viewpoint: the internal nonassociative structure influences which operators can be multiplied and localised, but the algebras themselves remain associative operator algebras; and different vacuum choices (different ω) lead to different Hilbert-space representations, without changing the underlying net 𝒜(𝒪).</p>\n\n<p>In an octonionic context, one can sketch the following assignment: to each spacetime region 𝒪 we assign an algebra 𝒜(𝒪) generated by localised rotor operators (internal symmetries), compressor fields encoding mass/mixing effects, and fluctuation modes of the Jordan element H. These generators satisfy commutation relations constrained by the exceptional symmetry (G₂, F₄) and by locality.</p>\n\n<p>The internal nonassociativity shows up in how these generators combine and in the structure of their spectra, not in the C*-algebra axioms themselves (which remain associative).</p>\n\n<p>The algebraic language does not forbid Feynman diagrams; it puts them in perspective. In simple regimes and near-Gaussian states, one can still expand correlation functions in diagrams. But: the existence of a Fock space and a perturbative expansion is no longer an axiom, but a property of certain states; nonperturbative aspects (phase structure, superselection sectors, thermal states) can be discussed directly in terms of algebras and states; and the nonassociative internal geometry is built into the operator content, not into a particular path integral measure.</p>\n\n<p>For an exceptional, nonassociative internal space, this is conceptually safer than starting from a single classical Lagrangian and hoping that perturbation theory can see everything.</p>\n\n<p>AQFT and spectral geometry address complementary aspects: spectral geometry (yesterday) tells us how to build an action from a Dirac spectrum that includes gravity and gauge fields; AQFT (today) tells us how to formulate the quantum theory of the resulting fields in a representation-free way.</p>\n\n<p>On December 21, the fourth Advent Sunday, these threads meet: an octonionic version of AQFT is combined with an F₄-symmetric Jordan potential. The electroweak scale then appears as an equilibrium quantity of the internal geometry, and the local algebras inherit this scale through their operator content.</p>\n\n<p>The AQFT day is less about new numbers and more about cleaning up the foundations: it frees the octonionic model from the straightjacket of a single Fock space and a fixed perturbative expansion; it highlights that what matters fundamentally are operators and their algebraic relations, not a particular graphical technique; and it prepares the ground for rigorous discussions of locality, causality and phases in a world with an exceptional internal structure.</p>\n\n<p>One hundred years after Heisenberg's operator approach, AQFT can be read as a modern continuation of his original spirit—now extended to an octonionic internal world that he could not have imagined.</p>"
