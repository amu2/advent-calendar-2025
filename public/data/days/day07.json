This is both a gift and a work assignment: the model delivers concrete results and honest open questions in equal measure.",
  "content": "<h3>From algebra to operators</h3>\n<p>Octonions and their automorphism group $G_2$ give us a\nrigid internal stage. But physical predictions are not read directly from\nthe multiplication table; they arise from <em>operators</em> acting on the\ninternal space. In this model, two operator families play the central role:</p><ul>\n  <li><strong>Rotors</strong> — antisymmetric operators $G_a$ generating internal\n        rotations: they encode forces and couplings.\n  <li><strong>Compressors</strong> — symmetric operators $C$ with real spectra:\n        they encode masses and mixing patterns.\n</ul><p>Once this toolbox is in place, every later sheet becomes a story about\neigenvalues, eigenvectors, commutators and norms of these operators.</p>\n<h3>The heptagon operator: seven directions, three invariants</h3>\n<p>The seven imaginary octonion units are arranged on the Fano-plane\nheptagon. Instead of handling them one by one, the model packages them\ninto a single <em>heptagon operator</em> $H_7$ acting on the internal space:\n\\[\n  H_7 \\;=\\; \\sum_{i=1}^7 c_i E_i,\n\\]\nwhere the $E_i$ encode the seven directions and the $c_i$ are fixed by the\nvacuum and $G_2$-symmetry.</p><p>Despite being built from seven directions, $H_7$ has only three independent\neigenvalues,\n\\[\n  \\mathrm{Spec}(H_7) = (\\alpha,\\beta,\\gamma),\n\\]\nwhich are invariants of the $G_2$-orbit of $H_7$. These three numbers will\nreappear as seeds for:</p><ul>\n  <li>gauge couplings (fine-structure, strong coupling, weak mixing),\n  <li>relative positions of flavour sectors,\n  <li>and parts of the hierarchy structure.\n</ul>\n<h3>The radius operator and three fundamental scales</h3>\n<p>From the heptagon structure one constructs a <em>radius operator</em> $R$.\nIt measures how far internal directions sit from preferred axes. Its\nspectrum is\n\\[\n  \\mathrm{Spec}(R) = (a_0,b_0,c_0),\n  \\quad a_0 > b_0 > c_0.\n\\]</p><p>Exponentials of these radii define three characteristic energy scales:\n\\[\n  E_{\\text{Planck}} \\sim e^{a_0},\\qquad\n  E_{\\text{EW}}     \\sim e^{b_0},\\qquad\n  E_{\\text{QCD}}    \\sim e^{c_0}.\n\\]\nThus, the familiar hierarchy of Planck, electroweak and QCD scales is\nencoded in a few geometric invariants of $R$ rather than inserted as three\nindependent inputs.</p>\n<h3>Rotors: forces from commutator norms</h3>\n<p>Rotors are antisymmetric operators $G_a$ generating continuous internal\nsymmetries. Their commutators measure how two internal directions fail to\ncommute. The squared norm of a commutator,\n\\[\n  \\bigl\\|[G_a,G_b]\\bigr\\|^2,\n\\]\nacts as the prototype for a coupling constant. Symbolically,\n\\[\n  \\alpha \\sim \\bigl\\|[G_{\\text{em}},G_{\\text{ref}}]\\bigr\\|^2,\\quad\n  \\alpha_s \\sim \\bigl\\|[G_{\\text{color}},G_{\\text{ref}}]\\bigr\\|^2,\\quad\n  \\sin^2\\theta_W \\sim \\bigl\\|[G_{\\text{weak}},G_{\\text{ref}}]\\bigr\\|^2.\n\\]</p><p>Choosing different rotor pairs recovers different interactions. In this\nview, a \"strong\" force is literally a large commutator norm in the\ninternal algebra; a \"weak\" one corresponds to nearly commuting rotors.</p>\n<h3>Compressors: masses and mixings as spectra</h3>\n<p>Compressors are symmetric operators with real eigenvalues. The most\nimportant example is the mass map $\\Pi(\\langle H\\rangle)$ constructed from\na vacuum configuration $\\langle H\\rangle \\in H_3(\\mathbb{O})$:\n\\[\n  \\Pi(\\langle H\\rangle)\\Psi = m\\,\\Psi.\n\\]</p><p>Its eigenvalues $m$ provide prototype fermion masses; its eigenvectors\ndefine the associated mass eigenstates. Additional compressors act in\nflavour subspaces; misalignment between their eigenbases produces mixing\nmatrices:</p><ul>\n  <li>down- vs. up-quark compressors $\\Rightarrow$ CKM matrix,\n  <li>charged-lepton vs. neutrino compressors $\\Rightarrow$ PMNS matrix.\n</ul><p>Masses and mixings thus share a common origin: they are different ways of\nreading the same symmetric operators.</p>\n<h3>Attractor behaviour of scales and hierarchies</h3>\n<p>The combination of radius operator and compressors suggests an\n<em>attractor</em> picture:</p><ul>\n  <li>The spectrum $(a_0,b_0,c_0)$ singles out preferred scales.\n  <li>Renormalisation-group flow tends to pull effective parameters\n        towards these scales.\n  <li>Small deformations of $\\langle H\\rangle$ move eigenvalues, but\n        certain patterns (like the large gap between Planck and EW) remain\n        stable.\n</ul><p>Hierarchies thus become <em>fixed points</em> of a dynamical process in\noperator space, not arbitrary distances between hand-picked numbers.</p>\n<h3>Why this toolbox is minimal and sufficient</h3>\n<p>What makes the toolbox attractive is its balance between simplicity and\npower:</p><ul>\n  <li>It is <em>minimal</em>: no independent Yukawa matrices, no\n        unmotivated extra symmetries, no long list of unrelated constants.\n  <li>It is <em>sufficient</em>: in principle, all quantities that enter\n        phenomenology—masses, mixing angles, couplings, scales—can be\n        expressed in terms of the invariants of these operators.\n</ul><p>The remaining Advent days flesh out this claim with concrete examples:\nfrom specific couplings (fine-structure, strong, Weinberg angle) to\nnumerical mass prototypes and flavour structures.</p><p>Dray<p><strong>Manogue1999</strong><br>\nT.~Dray and C.~A.~Manogue,\nThe Geometry of the Octonions,\nWorld Scientific, 1999.</p><p><p><strong>Dixon1994</strong><br>\nG.~M.~Dixon,\nDivision Algebras: Octonions, Quaternions, Complex Numbers and\nthe Algebraic Design of Physics,\nKluwer, 1994.</p><p>ChamseddineConnes<p><strong>Marcolli2007</strong><br>\nA.~H.~Chamseddine, A.~Connes and M.~Marcolli,\n\"Gravity and the standard model with neutrino mixing,\"\nAdv.\\ Theor.\\ Math.\\ Phys. <strong>11</strong>, 991--1089 (2007).</p>",

  "intro": "<p>We've spent the first week building the stage: octonions, their automorphism group $G_2$, triality, and the idea that internal degrees of freedom live in an eight-dimensional exceptional space. But a stage is not a play. To make physical predictions—to connect this abstract geometry to the numbers we measure in experiments—we need actors. In the octonionic model, those actors are operators.</p>\n\n<p>Today marks the Second Advent Sunday, and with it a shift in focus. We move from \"what is the internal space?\" to \"what do we do with it?\" The answer is surprisingly compact: all observable quantities—coupling constants, particle masses, mixing angles, energy scales—are traced back to the eigenvalues and norms of just two families of operators acting on the internal space.</p>\n\n<p>The first family consists of **rotors**: antisymmetric operators that generate internal rotations. Think of them as the mathematical embodiment of forces. When two rotors don't commute—when rotating in one internal direction and then another gives a different result than doing it in the opposite order—the size of that mismatch (measured by the norm of the commutator) becomes a coupling constant. A large mismatch means a strong force; a small mismatch means a weak one.</p>\n\n<p>The second family consists of **compressors**: symmetric operators with real eigenvalues. These encode masses and mixing patterns. The eigenvalues of a compressor give you particle masses; the eigenvectors tell you which combinations of fields have definite mass. When two compressors act on overlapping but slightly different subspaces—say, one for down-type quarks and one for up-type quarks—the misalignment between their eigenbases produces a mixing matrix like the CKM matrix.</p>\n\n<p>Two specific operators play starring roles in this toolbox:</p>\n\n<p>1. The **heptagon operator** $H_7$, which packages the seven imaginary octonion directions into a single object. Despite being built from seven directions, it has only three independent eigenvalues $(\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma)$, which are geometric invariants fixed by the $G_2$ symmetry. These three numbers will reappear as seeds for gauge couplings and flavor hierarchies.</p>\n\n<p>2. The **radius operator** $R$, which measures how far different sectors of the internal space sit from preferred axes. Its spectrum $(a_0, b_0, c_0)$ defines three characteristic scales. When you take exponentials—$\\exp(a_0)$, $\\exp(b_0)$, $\\exp(c_0)$—you naturally get the huge hierarchies we see in nature: Planck scale, electroweak scale, QCD scale. A difference of just 40 between two eigenvalues becomes a factor of $10^{17}$ after exponentiation.</p>\n\n<p>Why is this toolbox attractive? Because it's both minimal and sufficient. It's **minimal** in the sense that we're not adding independent Yukawa matrices, unmotivated extra symmetries, or long lists of unrelated constants. Everything comes from the same two operator families. And it's **sufficient** in the sense that, in principle, all the quantities that enter phenomenology can be expressed in terms of the invariants of these operators.</p>\n\n<p>The remaining Advent days will flesh out this claim with concrete examples: how the fine-structure constant $\\alpha \\approx 1/137$ emerges from rotor norms, how fermion masses arise from compressor spectra, how mixing matrices reflect misaligned eigenbases. But the conceptual foundation is laid today: physics is not a list of parameters—it's the spectrum of a small set of operators on an exceptional internal space.</p>\n\n<p>Let us see how rotors and compressors turn geometry into numbers.</p>"
