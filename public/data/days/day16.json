  "title": "Gravitation: the missing corner of the model",
  "subtitle": "Where the octonionic story reaches gravity – and where it still stops",
  "keyInsight": "Gravitation is not yet fully integrated into the octonionic sector; the ratio κ=m_p/m_P remains an external constant. This is an honest admission of open work, not a hidden flaw. The model clearly marks where it ends and where the next research step—spectral gravity—must begin.",
  "content": "<h3>How much is already covered</h3>\n<p>Before talking about what is missing, it is worth\nrecalling what is already under octonionic control:</p><ul>\n  <li>Internal quantum numbers are organised on an exceptional stage\n        ($\\mathbb{O}$, $H_3(\\mathbb{O})$, $G_2$, $F_4$).\n  <li>Couplings and mixing angles appear as norms and angles of rotor\n        commutators.\n  <li>Fermion masses and flavour structure arise as spectra of\n        compressors derived from a vacuum $\\langle H\\rangle$.\n  <li>Characteristic energy scales (Planck, electroweak, QCD) are linked\n        to invariants of the radius operator and attractor mechanisms.\n</ul><p>Within this internal sector, the story is fairly coherent: many quantities\nthat used to be independent inputs become different faces of the same\nexceptional geometry.</p>\n<h3>Enter gravity: a separate constant</h3>\n<p>Gravitation is encoded in general relativity by Newton's constant $G$, or,\nmore conveniently, by the Planck mass\n\\[\n  m_P = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar c}{G}}.\n\\]\nThe proton mass $m_p$ then defines a dimensionless ratio\n\\[\n  \\kappa = \\frac{m_p}{m_P},\n\\]\nnumerically of order $10^{-19}$.</p><p>In the present octonionic framework, $m_p$ is accessible in principle via\nthe compressor structure (it is one of the low-lying eigenvalues of the\nmass map), but $m_P$ is not yet derived: it is imported from gravitational\nphysics. Consequently, $\\kappa$ appears as an external constant rather than\nan internal invariant.</p>\n<h3>Why this is not a minor detail</h3>\n<p>At first glance, an extra constant might look harmless. But conceptually it\nmatters:</p><ul>\n  <li>Internally, the model claims a structural explanation of many\n        numbers (charges, couplings, fermion masses).\n  <li>Externally, gravity fixes the overall scale at which quantum\n        fields backreact on spacetime.\n</ul><p>Without a link between the internal exceptional geometry and spacetime\ngeometry, the story is incomplete: we know how fields behave on a given\nbackground, but we do not yet explain how that background itself emerges\nfrom the same algebraic structure.</p>\n<h3>Spectral geometry as the natural bridge</h3>\n<p>There is, however, a natural candidate framework to close this gap:\n<em>spectral geometry</em>. Instead of describing spacetime by a metric\n$g_{\\mu\\nu}$, one describes it by a Dirac operator $D$ on a suitable\nHilbert space. The spectral action principle then postulates an action\n\\[\n  S_{\\text{spec}} = \\mathrm{Tr}\\,f(D^2/\\Lambda^2),\n\\]\nwhose heat-kernel expansion generates:</p><ul>\n  <li>the Einstein--Hilbert term (gravity),\n  <li>a cosmological constant term,\n  <li>gauge and matter kinetic terms,\n  <li>and higher-order corrections.\n</ul><p>In the octonionic context, the hope is clear:</p><p>quote\n  Build a Dirac operator $D$ that encodes both spacetime geometry and the\n  internal octonionic/Albert structure, then read gravitational couplings\n  and the scale $\\Lambda$ from its spectrum.\nquote</p><p>In the language of this project, such a Dirac operator $D$ is not an\nadd-on but the same master operator that already organises the internal\nrotors, compressors and mass maps. Later in the calendar, this idea\nwill be made explicit in the form of a single master action $S[D,\\Psi]$\nthat packages internal and gravitational dynamics into one object.\nHere, we only flag this direction; the actual construction is deferred.</p><p>This would turn $G$, $\\kappa$ and even aspects of dark energy into\nspectral invariants of the same operator that already knows about internal\nrotors and compressors.</p>\n<h3>What is missing right now</h3>\n<p>The present model does <em>not</em> yet provide a final construction of such\na Dirac operator. Concretely:</p><ul>\n  <li>The exact Hilbert space on which $D$ acts, combining spacetime\n        spinors with octonionic internal data, has not been fixed.\n  <li>The interplay between nonassociative internal multiplication and\n        the standard differential-geometric structure of $D$ is not yet\n        fully understood.\n  <li>The computation that would derive $\\kappa$ from the spectrum of\n        $D$ is not available; $\\kappa$ is treated as known input.\n</ul><p>This is why gravity is called the \"missing corner\": it is not absent\nbecause it does not fit, but because the necessary spectral-geometric\nmachinery has not yet been fully built.</p>\n<h3>Why it is still worth taking the model seriously</h3>\n<p>Admitting an open gravitational block is not a weakness of honesty; it is\na strength of design:</p><ol>\n  <li>It clearly marks where the current octonionic explanations end and\n        where new ideas are needed.\n  <li>It suggests a concrete research programme rather than a vague hope:\n        construct an octonionic spectral triple and compute the resulting\n        gravitational sector.\n  <li>It prevents overclaiming: the model explains many things about\n        internal structure, but it does not pretend to have solved quantum\n        gravity.\n</ol><p>Seen this way, the gravitational day of the Advent calendar is less a\nconclusion than a pointer: it ties the exceptional internal geometry to\nthe next natural step in modern mathematical physics.</p>\n<h3>A clear boundary, not a blind spot</h3>\n<p>The main message of this sheet is thus intentionally simple:</p><p>quote\n  The octonionic model currently stops at the boundary of gravity. The\n  ratio $\\kappa = m_p/m_P$ is acknowledged as an external input, and a\n  spectral-gravity extension is needed to pull it inside the algebraic\n  story, eventually in the form of a unified action $S[D,\\Psi]$ whose\ngravitational coefficients are fixed by the same spectral data as the\ninternal ones.\nquote</p><p>The rest of the calendar—especially the spectral-geometry and AQFT days—\nshows that this next step is plausible, but it is not taken yet. One\nhundred years after Heisenberg, it is intellectually healthier to draw a\nsharp line between what has been structurally organised and what remains\nto be done.</p><p><p><strong>Einstein1915</strong><br>\nA.~Einstein,\n\"Die Feldgleichungen der Gravitation,\"\nSitzungsber.\\ Preuss.\\ Akad.\\ Wiss.

  "intro": "<p>The octonionic/Albert framework organises internal quantum numbers, masses, mixings, couplings and scales in a single operator toolbox. But gravity is not just an external background: in the matrix-first octonionic framework one can build algebraic analogues of curvature and Einstein equations from commutators and associators.</p>\n\n<p>In the matrix-first setting, states are octonionic matrices M∈M_n(𝕆), and left multiplication with a generator X is encoded by an operator L_X(M)=XM. Commutators of these left-multiplication operators</p>\n\n<p>𝒟(X,Y)(M) := [L_X,L_Y](M) = X(YM)-Y(XM)</p>\n\n<p>measure how much 'parallel transport' around a small loop fails to close, in direct analogy to [∇_μ,∇_ν] in differential geometry.</p>\n\n<p>For a basis {E_A} of such generators one defines quadratic defect components</p>\n\n<p>𝒢_AB(M) := Tr(𝒟(E_A,E_B)(M)·𝒟(E_A,E_B)(M)),</p>\n\n<p>which play the role of algebraic curvature invariants.</p>\n\n<p>For the special pair (e₁,e₂) of octonionic units one can compute explicitly:</p>\n\n<p>𝒟(e₁,e₂)(M) = 4e₇M,</p>\n\n<p>so that</p>\n\n<p>𝒢₁₂(M) = 16·Tr(M²) = 16·𝒯₁₂(M),</p>\n\n<p>where 𝒯₁₂(M):=Tr(M²) is the simplest quadratic 'matter' scalar built from M.</p>\n\n<p>This is not postulated but derived: it is a concrete algebraic relation of the shape</p>\n\n<p>𝒢₁₂ = κ_M·𝒯₁₂, κ_M=16,</p>\n\n<p>mirroring the structure of Einstein's field equations G_μν=8πG·T_μν in a highly simplified setting.</p>\n\n<p>Nonassociativity brings a second, deeper defect: the associator {x,y,z}=(xy)z-x(yz). Via left-multiplication it defines associator defect operators 𝔄(X,Y,Z) and, from these, an 'associator-based' curvature. By contraction one builds an algebraic Einstein tensor</p>\n\n<p>𝒢^assoz_μν(M) := ℛ_μν(M) - ½ℛ(M)·η_μν,</p>\n\n<p>which is symmetric and quadratic in associator defects. A central conjecture of the gravitation paper is that, in an appropriate coarse-graining / continuum limit,</p>\n\n<p>𝒢^assoz_μν(M) → c·G_μν(x)</p>\n\n<p>for some universal constant c and an emergent metric g_μν.</p>\n\n<p>On the purely algebraic side one can postulate a matrix Einstein system</p>\n\n<p>𝒢_AB(M) = κ_M·𝒯_AB(M),</p>\n\n<p>for a family of quadratic 'matter' tensors 𝒯_AB(M) and a single dimensionless constant κ_M. Choosing four distinguished generators E_μ (μ=0,1,2,3) and a projector P_μ^A to this subset, one defines effective 4D tensors. The hope is that, in the same continuum limit in which 𝒢^assoz_μν→cG_μν, these projected objects satisfy</p>\n\n<p>G_μν = 8πG·T_μν,</p>\n\n<p>so that Newton's constant G becomes a function of the matrix-level constant κ_M and of conversion factors ℏ,c.</p>\n\n<p>The universal Dirac-like equation of the project, DΨ = 0, with D=∂+A and A_μ∈𝔰𝔬(8), already encodes both spin connection (gravity) and internal gauge fields in a single object. The commutator [D_μ,D_ν] provides the usual field strengths F_μν, while the defect operators 𝒟(E_A,E_B) and associators 𝔄 capture 'internal' curvature.</p>\n\n<p>A spectral action</p>\n\n<p>S_spec[D] = Tr f(D²/Λ²)</p>\n\n<p>then generates an Einstein-Hilbert term and gauge kinetic terms from the spectrum of D. The same octonionic data that enter the defect and associator tensors also determine the effective Newton constant G_eff and cosmological constant Λ_eff in this spectral expansion.</p>\n\n<p>Compared to earlier versions, the status of gravity in the model is now twofold:\n• On the algebraic side, there exist explicit prototypes of Einstein-like relations (such as 𝒢₁₂=16·𝒯₁₂) and a well-defined associator-based Einstein tensor 𝒢^assoz_μν(M).\n• On the continuum side, it remains to prove the convergence of these objects to the classical Einstein tensor and to compute the physical Newton constant G and the proton-Planck ratio κ=m_p/m_P from the spectrum of a unified Dirac operator D.</p>\n\n<p>The message of this sheet is therefore sharper than before: Gravity is no longer a completely missing corner. The algebraic infrastructure of curvature and Einstein-like relations exists on the octonionic matrix stage; what is still missing is the rigorous continuum limit and the full spectral computation of G and κ.</p>"
