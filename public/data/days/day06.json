  "intro": "<p>In modern physics, we usually think of three separate theories. There's the Dirac equation, which describes how matter particles like electrons and quarks move and interact. There are the Yang-Mills equations, which govern the gauge bosons—the photon, gluons, and W and Z bosons that carry forces. And there's Einstein's general relativity, which describes gravity through the curvature of spacetime.</p>\n\n<p>These three theories work beautifully in their respective domains, but they feel logically separate. We write them down as distinct sets of equations, with different mathematical structures and different physical interpretations. It's a bit like having three separate instruction manuals for a single machine—each manual is useful, but you can't help wondering if there's a unified blueprint underneath.</p>\n\n<p>What if there is? What if all three theories—matter, gauge forces, and gravity—are not independent starting points but different projections of a single, deeper equation?</p>\n\n<p>This is the idea behind today's sheet. In the octonionic model, there is only one fundamental transport equation, written as $D\\Psi = 0$, where $D = \\partial + A$ is a covariant derivative built from an $\\mathfrak{so}(8)$-valued connection $A_\\mu$ acting on an eight-component field $\\Psi$. The connection $A_\\mu$ contains both the spin connection (which encodes gravity) and the internal gauge fields (which encode the Standard Model forces). The field $\\Psi$ carries both gravitational and internal quantum numbers.</p>\n\n<p>The familiar equations we know—Dirac, Yang-Mills, Einstein—are not separate laws. They are different ways of looking at this single master equation:</p>\n\n<p>- The **Dirac equation** is what you see when you project $D\\Psi = 0$ onto the fermionic components of $\\Psi$ and treat the connection as a fixed background.</p>\n\n<p>- The **Yang-Mills equations** emerge as consistency conditions—the requirement that the connection $A$ be compatible with itself, expressed through its curvature $F_{\\mu\\nu} = [D_\\mu, D_\\nu]$.</p>\n\n<p>- The **Einstein equations** (or their effective counterpart) arise from the curvature of the spin connection part of $A_\\mu$.</p>\n\n<p>Why does this matter? Because it suggests that the apparent diversity of fundamental physics—matter, forces, gravity—is not a collection of unrelated phenomena. It's a single geometric structure, viewed from different angles. The octonionic internal space provides the stage where all these angles fit together naturally.</p>\n\n<p>Think of today's sheet as a unification statement: not in the sense of a \"theory of everything\" that predicts every detail, but in the sense of a single mathematical framework that contains all three classical theories as special cases. The equation $D\\Psi = 0$ is not just compact notation—it's a statement about the underlying unity of the octonionic geometry.</p>\n\n<p>Let us see how one equation replaces three separate theories.</p>"
