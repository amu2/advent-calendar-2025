  "intro": "<p>An octonionic model of particle physics must pass two hard tests: it has to admit a mathematically clean quantisation, and it has to explain why the electroweak scale sits where it does. Both issues meet on this fourth Advent Sunday. An algebraic quantum field theory (AQFT) formulation replaces Hilbert-space dogma by local algebras on the octonionic stage, while an F₄-symmetric potential fixes the electroweak scale Y_S as a true equilibrium quantity:</p>\n\n<p>Y_S² = -μ²/(2(λ+κc)).</p>\n\n<p>In the refined universe-parameter picture, this equilibrium value is also a function of the structural and geometric invariants (p_S,p_G) of the Symmetry Atlas.</p>\n\n<p>Standard quantum field theory is usually presented as a story about fields on spacetime, quantised on a Hilbert space and expanded in creation and annihilation operators. For highly nontrivial internal structures like octonions and the Albert algebra, this picture is more a hindrance than a help.</p>\n\n<p>Algebraic quantum field theory (AQFT) offers a different starting point: the fundamental objects are local *-algebras 𝒜(𝒪) assigned to spacetime regions 𝒪. States are positive linear functionals ω: 𝒜(𝒪) → ℂ, not vectors in a pre-chosen Hilbert space. Dynamics and symmetries act as automorphisms of the net 𝒪 ↦ 𝒜(𝒪).</p>\n\n<p>This fits the octonionic framework naturally: the internal degrees of freedom live in nonassociative structures; their observables sit more comfortably in operator algebras than in a single global Hilbert basis. Locality and covariance are built into the net of algebras, not into a particular field representation.</p>\n\n<p>In the present model, the internal octonionic/Albert structure augments ordinary spacetime. A minimal AQFT-compatible picture is: to each spacetime region 𝒪 we assign a local algebra 𝒜(𝒪) generated by rotor operators (internal symmetry generators), compressor-derived fields (mass/mixing structures), and scalar modes related to the Jordan potential and to the vacuum configuration ⟨H⟩. The net 𝒪↦𝒜(𝒪) satisfies the Haag-Kastler axioms: isotony, locality (commutativity at spacelike separation), covariance under the relevant spacetime symmetries.</p>\n\n<p>Quantisation in this picture means: we specify the algebra and its relations, then look at representations (states) that realise this net on Hilbert spaces a posteriori. This reverses the usual logic: instead of quantising classical fields, we start from an operator algebra informed by octonionic geometry. Hilbert spaces appear only as GNS completions of chosen states, not as primary input.</p>\n\n<p>Beyond the kinematics of local algebras, we need dynamics and vacuum structure. The central object is a Jordan element H ∈ H₃(𝕆) and a potential V_J(H) that is invariant under an F₄ symmetry acting on the Albert algebra.</p>\n\n<p>A typical F₄-invariant potential has the schematic form</p>\n\n<p>V_J(H) = μ²·Tr(H²) + λ·Tr(H⁴) + κ·c·(det H) + ...,</p>\n\n<p>where the invariants (trace, determinant, higher Jordan invariants) are organised such that F₄ acts as the symmetry group of the potential.</p>\n\n<p>The electroweak order parameter Y_S is then read as a particular component or invariant of the vacuum expectation value ⟨H⟩. Minimising V_J with respect to this degree of freedom leads to a condition of the form</p>\n\n<p>∂V_J/∂Y_S = 0 ⟹ Y_S² = -μ²/(2(λ+κc)).</p>\n\n<p>The formula should be read structurally, not numerically. It expresses three key points: the electroweak scale is not inserted by hand; it is a minimum of an F₄-symmetric potential. The same invariants that control the structure of the operator toolbox (rotors, compressors, radius operator) also enter the coefficients (μ²,λ,κc). In the universe-parameter picture, these coefficients are not free but functions of the structural and geometric invariants (p_S,p_G) that characterise the Symmetry Atlas sector in which our universe lives.</p>\n\n<p>Small changes in (p_S,p_G) and the Atlas configuration thus lead to controlled shifts in Y_S, not to arbitrary values: the 246 GeV scale is both an equilibrium of the exceptional internal space and a function of two deeper universe parameters.</p>\n\n<p>The AQFT, potential and universe-parameter pictures are not separate stories: the potential V_J(H) determines the vacuum configuration ⟨H⟩, hence the compressor spectra and the operator content of the local algebras 𝒜(𝒪). The structural and geometric sector invariants (p_S,p_G) constrain the allowed forms of V_J and thus indirectly fix the possible equilibrium values Y_S. Conversely, the dynamics of fields in AQFT—encoded in the local algebras and their time evolution—are constrained by the same internal symmetries (G₂, F₄) and sector structure that define (p_S,p_G,p_T).</p>\n\n<p>This dual view is typical of modern mathematical physics: on the operator side, we quantise via local algebras and states, avoiding early commitment to particular Fock spaces. On the potential and parameter side, we see vacuum structure, symmetry breaking and scale setting as consequences of exceptional invariants and of the universe parameters of the Atlas.</p>\n\n<p>The fourth Advent Sunday is intentionally honest about open questions: the gravitational sector is not yet fully encoded; the ratio κ = m_p/m_P still enters as an external constant, to be addressed by a future spectral-gravity analysis that combines D, the algebraic Einstein prototypes and the universe parameters. Renormalisation and nonperturbative effects in an octonionic AQFT remain technically challenging.</p>\n\n<p>But we gain three important things: a quantisation framework—AQFT—that is robust enough to house nonassociative internal structures; a structural explanation of the electroweak scale as an equilibrium value of an F₄-symmetric potential, tightly linked to the rest of the operator toolbox; and a first link between this equilibrium and the universe parameters (p_S,p_G), which classify whole universe types in the Symmetry Atlas.</p>\n\n<p>Octonionic AQFT and an F₄-symmetric potential turn the electroweak scale from a fitted number into an equilibrium of the internal exceptional geometry, and link it to deeper universe parameters (p_S,p_G) in the Symmetry Atlas.</p>"
