  "intro": "<p>One of the most puzzling features of particle physics is the existence of extreme hierarchies. The top quark is about 300,000 times heavier than the electron. The Planck scale is about $10^{17}$ times higher than the electroweak scale. These are not small differences—they're enormous gaps that span many orders of magnitude.</p>\n\n<p>In conventional field theory, such hierarchies are technically allowed but conceptually uncomfortable. You can write down a Lagrangian with a light electron and a heavy top quark, but you have to put in their mass ratio by hand. There's no mechanism that naturally generates such huge gaps—in fact, quantum corrections tend to pull all masses toward the same scale unless you carefully fine-tune the parameters. This is the essence of the hierarchy problem.</p>\n\n<p>What if these extreme gaps are not accidents that need fine-tuning, but natural consequences of the internal geometry? What if the very structure of the octonions—specifically, their failure to be associative—is the source of hierarchies?</p>\n\n<p>This is the idea behind today's sheet. Octonions are nonassociative: in general, $(ab)c \\neq a(bc)$. For most number systems we're used to—real numbers, complex numbers, quaternions—this equation always holds. But for octonions, it fails. The deviation is measured by the <strong>associator</strong>, defined as $[a,b,c] := (ab)c - a(bc)$.</p>\n\n<p>At first, nonassociativity sounds like a technical nuisance—a complication that makes calculations harder. But in the octonionic model, it's a feature, not a bug. The associator is not just a measure of \"how badly\" multiplication fails to be associative—it's a structured quantity whose norm can be used to control the size of hierarchies.</p>\n\n<p>Here's the key observation: not all directions in the octonions are equally nonassociative. If you pick three elements $a$, $b$, $c$ that all lie in the same quaternionic subalgebra inside $\\mathbb{O}$, then $[a,b,c] = 0$—they're perfectly associative. These are \"flat\" directions. But if you pick a triple that genuinely probes the full octonionic structure, you typically get $[a,b,c] \\neq 0$—these are \"curved\" directions.</p>\n\n<p>The model suggests a simple picture: light particles and low-energy scales live predominantly in nearly associative (almost quaternionic) directions, while heavy particles and high-energy scales probe strongly nonassociative (genuinely octonionic) directions. The associator norm $\\|[a,b,c]\\|$ becomes a geometric dial between \"light\" and \"heavy.\"</p>\n\n<p>Why does this produce exponentially large hierarchies? Because the relationship between associator norm and physical scale is not linear—it's exponential. Schematically, one can write</p>\n\n<p>$\\text{hierarchy factor} \\sim \\bigl(1+\\gamma \\|[a,b,c]\\|\\bigr)^N,$</p>\n\n<p>where $N$ is a the iteration count (e.g. $N \\approx 20-40$). A moderate  associator norm, compounded over these steps, naturally generates the enourmous rations (like $10^{17}$) observed between the Planck and electroweak scales.</p>\n\n<p>This is a fundamentally different attitude toward hierarchies. In conventional field theory, large gaps are puzzles that require explanation—usually through additional symmetries or fine-tuning. In the octonionic model, large gaps are the default: they're what you expect when you drop associativity. The puzzle is not \"why are there hierarchies?\" but \"why are some scales close together?\"—and the answer is that those scales live in nearly associative directions.</p>\n\n<p>Think of today's sheet as connecting an abstract algebraic property—the failure of associativity—to one of the most concrete and puzzling features of the Standard Model: the extreme range of masses and scales. If this connection can be made numerically sharp, nonassociativity moves from a mathematical curiosity to a central player in explaining the structure of the physical world.</p>\n\n<p>Let us see how $(ab)c \\neq a(bc)$ turns into mass and scale gaps.</p>"
