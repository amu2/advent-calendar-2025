\section*{From mysterious constant to geometric norm}

\AdventInitial{F}{ew} numbers in physics have attracted as much fascination
as the fine-structure constant,
\[
  \alpha \;=\; \frac{e^2}{4\pi\varepsilon_0\hbar c}
  \;\approx\; \frac{1}{137.035999\ldots}.
\]
Historically, $\alpha$ enters quantum electrodynamics as a dimensionless
coupling: it controls the strength of electromagnetic interactions and
the convergence of perturbation theory. For decades, it has been treated
as a parameter to be measured, not derived.

In the octonionic model, $\alpha$ is no longer a free parameter. It
appears as the squared norm of a commutator built from internal
\emph{rotors} in the exceptional geometry. The value of $\alpha$ is
tied to how certain planes inside the octonionic/Albert algebra are
oriented with respect to each other.

\section*{Internal rotors and commutators}

The internal space of the model is not a simple Lie algebra like
$\mathfrak{su}(2)$ or $\mathfrak{su}(3)$ in isolation. Instead, it sits
inside the exceptional Lie algebra associated with the Albert algebra
$H_3(\mathbb{O})$ and its symmetry group $F_4$.

Within this setting, one considers special operators $R_a$, $R_b$, \dots,
which act as \emph{rotors} on selected internal subspaces. Schematically,
one writes
\[
  R_a \;\sim\; \exp(\theta_a X_a),
  \qquad
  R_b \;\sim\; \exp(\theta_b X_b),
\]
where $X_a$, $X_b$ are generators associated with particular internal
directions (for instance, those tied to weak isospin and hypercharge).

The key object is the commutator
\[
  [R_a, R_b]
  \;\approx\;
  \theta_a\theta_b [X_a,X_b]
\]
in an appropriate small-angle limit. The \emph{norm} of this commutator
defines an effective coupling:
\[
  \alpha \;\propto\; \bigl\|[R_a,R_b]\bigr\|^2.
\]
Choosing $R_a$ and $R_b$ according to the embedding of $U(1)_{\text{em}}$
inside the internal algebra singles out the electromagnetic coupling.

\section*{From abstract norm to a concrete number}

The statement that $\alpha$ is given by a squared norm would be empty if
the norm could be tuned at will. The nontrivial part is that in the
octonionic/Albert setting the relevant rotors are highly constrained:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Triality and $G_2$-compatibility fix how vector and spinor
        directions in $\mathbb{R}^8$ are related.
  \item The Jordan structure of $H_3(\mathbb{O})$ restricts which
        combinations of internal directions can appear as ``legal''
        rotors.
  \item The vacuum configuration $\langle H\rangle$ selects preferred
        eigen-directions and thereby preferred planes in which the
        rotors act.
\end{itemize}

Under these constraints, the norm $\bigl\|[R_a,R_b]\bigr\|^2$ is not a
continuously tunable parameter. It falls into discrete bands determined
by the eigenvalues of certain internal projectors and compressor
operators. One of these bands lands numerically in the vicinity of
$1/137$, and this is identified with the observed fine-structure
constant at a particular reference scale.

\section*{Relations to strong and weak couplings}

The same construction can be repeated for other choices of rotors:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Rotors associated with the $SU(3)$ color directions lead to an
        effective strong coupling $\alpha_s$.
  \item Rotors associated with the weak isospin and hypercharge mixture
        lead to $\sin^2\theta_W$, the weak mixing angle.
\end{itemize}

The guiding principle is that \emph{all} gauge couplings arise as norms
of commutators of rotors in the same internal algebra. This leads to
relations of the symbolic form
\[
  \alpha \;\sim\; \|[R_{\text{em}},R_{\text{ref}}]\|^2,
  \qquad
  \alpha_s \;\sim\; \|[R_{\text{color}},R_{\text{ref}}]\|^2,
  \qquad
  \sin^2\theta_W \;\sim\; \|[R_{\text{weak}},R_{\text{ref}}]\|^2,
\]
where $R_{\text{ref}}$ is a common reference rotor set by the vacuum
configuration in $H_3(\mathbb{O})$.

In this picture, the observed pattern of couplings is a fingerprint of
how the vacuum sits inside the exceptional algebra, not a list of
independent constants.

\section*{Scaling and running}

Of course, $\alpha$ is not a rigid number: in quantum field theory it
runs with energy scale. The octonionic model does not deny this; instead
it separates two roles:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The \emph{bare geometric value}, determined by the internal
        rotor norm at a natural reference scale.
  \item The \emph{renormalized value} seen in experiments at a given
        energy, obtained by standard running from that reference scale.
\end{enumerate}

The contribution of the geometry is to fix the starting point and the
relative pattern of couplings. The quantum field theoretic machinery of
running and thresholds then dresses these values to the ones we measure.

\section*{A different attitude towards constants}

If $\alpha$ comes from an internal rotor norm, then the traditional
question ``Why $1/137$\,?'' shifts its focus. Instead of asking for a
closed-form expression in terms of $\pi$ and $e$ alone, we ask:

\begin{quote}
  Why does the vacuum select exactly this arrangement of internal
  directions in the exceptional algebra?
\end{quote}

In other words, the mystery moves from ``a magic number'' to
``a specific geometric configuration''. This may or may not be more
satisfying philosophically, but it is technically more tractable: one
can compute norms of commutators, study their spectra, and connect them
to the attractor dynamics discussed later in the Advent series.
